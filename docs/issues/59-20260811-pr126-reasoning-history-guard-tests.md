## Overview

PR #126 addresses the two non-blocking review notes left on the already-merged PR #123 (DeepSeek V4 multi-turn `reasoning_content` echo fix). It is a pure quality pass: no behavior change, no new feature, no shipped-user-visible effect. The extension gains a defensive `typeof` guard on a proposed VS Code API and the reasoning-history logic that was previously inlined in `src/extension.ts` gets its own unit-tested pure module.

The branch also carries the same `tmp/` ignore + `.gitignore`-aware tooling commits as PR #125 (cherry-picked so lint passed on `main` before #125 landed). After #125 merged (commit `3001d68`, 2026-08-11T07:22:30Z), those commits are content-identical to `main` and auto-reconcile during merge.

## Problem

### Review note 1 — missing `typeof` guard

`thinkingPartText()` in `src/extension.ts` (added by PR #123) used:

```ts
if (!(part instanceof vscode.LanguageModelThinkingPart)) {
  return "";
}
```

`LanguageModelThinkingPart` is a proposed VS Code API. The extension's `engines.vscode: ^1.125.0` guarantees it is present at runtime (API shipped August 2025, VS Code PR #259939), and the `src/vscode.proposed.languageModelThinkingPart.d.ts` augmentation already documents the `typeof ... === 'function'` guard as the recommended pattern. `src/streaming.ts` follows that pattern via `thinkingPartConstructor` (lines 261–265), but the `extension.ts` site added by #123 did not.

This is safe on every supported host today, but inconsistent with the codebase's own defensive convention and with the contract documented in the type augmentation.

### Review note 2 — no unit tests for the gating logic

`shouldEchoThinkingHistory()` and the value-normalization logic inside `thinkingPartText()` are pure functions but lived inline in `src/extension.ts`, which is not unit-testable without a VS Code host. The family gating (`shouldEchoThinkingHistory`) is regression-prone by design: it is the mirror of the MiMo carve-out from issue #38, and any future edit to the family list has no automated coverage today.

---

## Solution

PR #126 (branch `fix/reasoning-history-guard-tests`, **+151/−51** across 3 commits) makes two changes:

### 1. `typeof` guard added to `thinkingPartText()` (`src/extension.ts`)

```ts
function thinkingPartText(part: unknown): string {
  if (typeof vscode.LanguageModelThinkingPart !== "function" || !(part instanceof vscode.LanguageModelThinkingPart)) {
    return "";
  }
  return thinkingTextFromValue(part.value);
}
```

The `instanceof` check stays in the caller (the caller needs the part instance), and the value normalization is delegated to the new pure helper. This now mirrors the `streaming.ts` pattern exactly.

### 2. New pure module `src/reasoningHistory.ts`

Two exported functions extracted from `extension.ts`:

- **`thinkingTextFromValue(value: string | string[]): string`** — normalizes a `LanguageModelThinkingPart.value` (plain string or array of string chunks) into a single string. Drops non-string chunks defensively.
- **`shouldEchoThinkingHistory(rawModelId: string | undefined): boolean`** — unchanged family gating logic, moved verbatim. CONTRACT preserved.

### 3. Unit test suite `src/test/reasoningHistory.test.ts` (+16 tests → 177/177 pass)

Covers:

| Function                      | Cases                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thinkingTextFromValue()`     | plain strings, string chunk arrays, non-string chunks dropped, empty string, empty array                                                                          |
| `shouldEchoThinkingHistory()` | `undefined` (no echo), DeepSeek/Kimi/GLM/Qwen/MiniMax (echo), Gemini (echo), MiMo/GPT/Claude (no echo, preserves issue #38 carve-out), unknown model id (no echo) |

### 4. Tooling commits (shared with PR #125)

Two commits on this branch are content-identical to commits that already landed on `main` via #125:

- `chore: ignore tmp/ for temporary files` (`.gitignore` + `tmp/**` in `.vscodeignore`)
- `chore(tooling): linters/formatters honor .gitignore at runtime` (`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `scripts/gitignore-patterns.mjs`, ESLint flat config derives ignores from `.gitignore`, Prettier `--ignore-path .gitignore`)

After #125 merged, these auto-reconcile to no-ops on merge.

### Residual note (out of scope for this PR)

`src/extension.ts:3545` still has an unguarded `part instanceof vscode.LanguageModelThinkingPart` inside `processAssistantMessage()` (the caller that collects thinking text). This site predates PR #123 and is **not** touched by #126. It is safe under the supported engine floor but is a candidate for a follow-up consistency pass so every proposed-API use in the extension uses the same guard pattern.

## Merge Record

- **Method:** **merge commit** `7be0c06` (`gh pr merge 126 --merge`). Never squash — this preserves contributor commits per the project merge policy (PR #39 incident).
- **Order vs #125:** #125 already merged (`3001d68`), so #126 merged as-is without rebase. The tooling commits auto-reconciled as predicted (0 conflicts, verified pre-merge).
- **Shipped in:** release `0.5.2` (2026-08-11).

## Release Plan (0.5.2)

This PR is one of the inputs to release `0.5.2`. The DeepSeek V4 multi-turn 400 fix (#123, already on `main` but unreleased) is the primary driver: the bug affects every OpenCode user running DeepSeek V4 Flash in the marketplace `0.5.1` build, and the whole point of the extension is letting those users run DeepSeek inside Copilot Chat.

Release steps (each gate requires maintainer approval):

1. Merge PR #126 (`--merge`).
2. Merge dependabot #91 (`@types/node` 26.1.0 → 26.1.2, patch bump, `--merge`).
3. Bump `package.json` version `0.5.1` → `0.5.2`.
4. Finalize `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` → `[0.5.2] — 2026-08-11`.
5. `npm run compile` clean check.
6. Tag `v0.5.2` + publish to VS Code Marketplace (requires `vsce` login / PAT).

**Deferred:** dependabot #90 (TypeScript 6 → 7 major bump). Major toolchain bumps need a separate local build verification pass and are not part of the 0.5.2 cut.

See `docs/issues/60-20260811-release-0-5-2-plan.md` for the full release runbook.
