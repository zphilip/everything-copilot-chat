## Timeline

### 1. 2026-05-17 — PR Analysis & Review

**Problem:** First external community PR (#1) was submitted by [@Wallacy](https://github.com/Wallacy) from fork `Wallacy/opencode-copilot-chat`. As a first-time open-source maintainer, the project owner needed to understand the PR, evaluate its quality, and decide whether to merge.

**PR Details:**

| Item        | Value                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**   | `feat: add opencodego.freeOnly to expose paid Zen models` |
| **Author**  | @Wallacy (fork contributor)                               |
| **Branch**  | `Wallacy:feat/zen-freeOnly-config` → `ltmoerdani:main`    |
| **Size**    | +14 / -4 lines across 4 files                             |
| **CI**      | ✅ GitGuardian Security Checks — No secrets detected      |
| **Reviews** | None                                                      |

**Analysis Performed:**

1. **Code Review** — Examined all 4 changed files:
   - `src/extension.ts` (1 addition, 1 deletion) — Core filter logic
   - `package.json` (5 additions) — Setting registration
   - `README.md` (4 additions, 3 deletions) — Documentation
   - `CHANGELOG.md` (4 additions) — Release notes

2. **Quality Assessment:**

   | Criteria               | Rating       | Notes                                                   |
   | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Backward Compatibility | ✅ Excellent | Default `true` = old behavior unchanged                 |
   | Code Quality           | ✅ Good      | Clean one-liner, readable                               |
   | Documentation          | ✅ Excellent | README, CHANGELOG, description all updated              |
   | Security               | ✅ Pass      | GitGuardian clear                                       |
   | Naming Convention      | ✅ Excellent | `opencodego.freeOnly` consistent with existing settings |
   | Scope                  | ✅ Excellent | Focused, minimal, no unnecessary changes                |

3. **Mechanism Explained to Maintainer:**

   Before PR #1, Zen provider had a hardcoded filter:

   ```ts
   // OLD — always free-only
   filterModel: (modelId) => modelId.endsWith("-free") || FREE_ZEN_MODEL_IDS.has(modelId);
   ```

   After PR #1:

   ```ts
   // NEW — user-controllable
   filterModel: (modelId) =>
     vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("opencodego").get("freeOnly", true)
       ? modelId.endsWith("-free") || FREE_ZEN_MODEL_IDS.has(modelId) // true = free only
       : true; // false = show all
   ```

4. **Important Clarification** — The `freeOnly` setting and the API key are **independent**:
   - Setting controls **which models appear** in the picker
   - API key controls **whether requests are accepted** by OpenCode servers
   - Setting `freeOnly = false` shows paid models, but using them requires a paid API key or account balance

**Result:** ✅ PR deemed safe, clean, and well-documented.

### 2. 2026-05-17 — Local Testing

**Action:** Checked out PR branch locally and tested in Extension Development Host.

**Steps:**

```bash
# Fetch and checkout PR branch
gh pr checkout 1

# Compile
npm run compile
# → Success, no errors

# Launch Extension Development Host (F5 in VS Code)
```

**Test Cases Verified:**

| Test Case                   | Expected                                       | Result       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `freeOnly = true` (default) | Only free Zen models visible in picker         | ✅ Confirmed |
| `freeOnly = false`          | All Zen models (free + paid) visible in picker | ✅ Confirmed |
| Compile after checkout      | No TypeScript errors                           | ✅ Confirmed |

**Result:** ✅ PR changes work correctly locally.

### 3. 2026-05-17 — Branch Management & Merge

**Action:** Merged PR #1 following a `develop` → `main` workflow with several iterations.

**Initial Attempt (Reverted):**

1. Manually merged PR branch into `develop` with `--no-ff`
2. Compiled successfully
3. Realized the PR should be merged via GitHub UI for proper attribution

**Correct Workflow:**

1. Reverted the manual merge commit from `develop` (commit `ff5b12a`)
2. Reverted the revert commit (commit `e8ccab5`) — both removed via `git reset --hard`
3. Reset `develop` to original state (`34bc494`)
4. Force-pushed clean `develop` to GitHub

**Final Merge (via GitHub UI):**

1. Merged PR #1 via GitHub → creates merge commit `bb10020` on `main`
2. Pulled `main` locally to sync
3. Merged `main` into `develop` with `--no-ff`:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff main -m "Merge main (PR #1: add opencodego.freeOnly) into develop"
   # → Commit 679c224
   git push origin develop
   ```

**Git History (Final State):**

```text
*   679c224 (develop) Merge main (PR #1: add opencodego.freeOnly) into develop
|\
| *   bb10020 (origin/main, main) Merge pull request #1 from Wallacy/feat/zen-freeOnly-config
| |\
| | * 0565385 feat: add opencodego.freeOnly to expose paid Zen models
| |/
| * 2d2943a Bump version to 0.1.3
* | 34bc494 Update changelog and README for improved model filtering
|/
```

**Result:** ✅ PR merged to `main` via GitHub, synced to `develop`.

**Action:** Maintainer responded to PR and related issue.

**PR Comment (recommended):**

> Thanks a lot for the contribution, @Wallacy!

**Issue Response:**

> Closed as completed. Fixed via PR #1. Marketplace release pending (next publish).

**Result:** ✅ Community interaction handled professionally.
