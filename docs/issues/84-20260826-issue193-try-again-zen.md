## Problem

Issue [#193](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/193) reports
that the "Try again" error appears **frequently** during conversation, regardless
of which model is selected, on **OpenCode Zen** (free tier):

```text
OpenCode Zen response stream ended before completion (no [DONE] or finish_reason
after 355167 bytes / 11 events, request req-0d2f99d1).
```

The error fires **after** the model has delivered its content — the user sees the
response in the chat, then the error popup appears. The stack trace shows the
error was thrown from `streamOpenCodeResponse` (engine.js:437:34) after **3
transparent retries** were exhausted (engine.js:415:17 recursed 3×).

## Root cause

### Evolution of the truncation detection

The truncation detection went through several iterations:

1. **#170** (v0.6.0): Added `isStreamTruncated()` — first detection of streams
   ending without `[DONE]`/`finish_reason`. Previously: silent empty reply.
2. **#178** (v0.6.0): Added transparent retry for truncated streams before first
   content. But **threw error** after content was delivered.
3. **#187** (v0.7.1): **Muse Spark fix** — when `extractedPartCount > 0` AND
   `!workIncomplete`, return success instead of throwing.
4. **#188** (v0.7.1): **Tool-call guard** — added `hasCompletePendingWork`
   callback; if tool-call arguments are truncated mid-JSON, still throw error.

### The bug

The `#187` fix had a condition that was too narrow:

```typescript
const workIncomplete = options.hasCompletePendingWork?.() === false;
if (extractedPartCount > 0 && !workIncomplete) {
  // → success (warn log)
  return;
}
// → throw error
```

The `hasCompletePendingWork` callback checked whether pending tool calls had
parseable arguments (via `ToolCallAccumulator.hasCompletePendingCalls()`). For
text-only streams this returned `true` (no pending calls), so the success path
was taken.

**However**, the `finally` block in every transport adapter (`responses.ts`,
`chatCompletions.ts`, etc.) **already** calls `flushRemainingToolCalls()`,
which drops incomplete tool calls without emitting them (added in #188). So the
engine-level `hasCompletePendingWork` guard was **redundant** — the transport
had already handled the incomplete-call case. The redundant guard meant that
**any** stream truncation after content delivery could still throw, depending on
the `hasCompletePendingWork` state.

### Why it affected all models on Zen

The OpenCode Zen gateway (free tier) systematically drops HTTP/SSE connections
without sending `data: [DONE]` or a `response.completed` event with
`stop_reason`. This is a gateway quirk, not a truncation — the content was fully
delivered. #187 only fixed this for Muse Spark; the same quirk affects **all**
models on Zen (and potentially any provider whose gateway behaves similarly).

The error stack trace confirmed the failure path:

- 3 retries exhausted (stream truncated before any content)
- 4th attempt delivered 355KB / 11 events of content
- But no `[DONE]`/`finish_reason` → `isStreamTruncated()` returned `true`
- `extractedPartCount > 0` → but `hasCompletePendingWork` returned `false`
  (or was evaluated in a way that led to the throw path)
- → error thrown with "Try again" popup

## Fix

### 1. `src/transports/engine.ts` — Remove the `hasCompletePendingWork` guard

When content was already delivered to VS Code, always return success. The
transport's `finally` block already handles incomplete tool calls (drops them
without emitting). The engine-level guard was redundant and caused false
positives.

```typescript
// Before:
const workIncomplete = options.hasCompletePendingWork?.() === false;
if (extractedPartCount > 0 && !workIncomplete) {
  // → success
  return;
}
// → throw error

// After:
if (extractedPartCount > 0) {
  // → success (warn log)
  return;
}
// → throw error
```

### 2. `src/transports/streamParts.ts` — Remove `hasCompletePendingWork` option

The option is no longer consulted by the engine.

### 3. `src/transports/responses.ts` — Remove `hasCompletePendingWork` wiring

The `hasCompletePendingWork: () => extractor.hasCompletePendingToolCalls()` is
removed from the `streamOpenCodeResponse` options.

### 4. `src/transports/extractors.ts` — Remove `hasCompletePendingToolCalls()` method

The method is no longer called from outside. `flushRemainingToolCalls()` still
uses `toolCallAccumulator.hasCompletePendingCalls()` internally.
