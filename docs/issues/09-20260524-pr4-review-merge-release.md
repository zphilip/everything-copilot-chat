## Overview

External contributor Wallacy submitted PR #4 adding native Zen GPT/Gemini/Claude routing, TTL-cached `models.dev` metadata, and request hardening. This session covered the full review cycle: initial analysis, risk assessment, feedback to contributor, verification of updates, branch conflict resolution, cherry-picking 0.1.5 vision fixes, clean merge, and marketplace release packaging.

## Timeline

### 1. 2026-05-23 — Initial PR Analysis

**Problem:** PR #4 arrived with +1,815 / -206 lines across 5 files, bumping `extension.ts` from ~1,960 to ~3,527 lines. Three major changes needed evaluation:

- Native transport routing for Zen GPT (`/responses`), Gemini (Google-style), Claude (`/messages`), and Go MiniMax (`/messages`)
- TTL-cached `models.dev` metadata merged with live `/models` and bundled fallback
- Request timeouts, sticky session headers, and rate-limit error handling

**Action:** Read the full PR diff (94KB). Identified the three feature areas and assessed risk.

**Status:** ✅ Analysis complete

### 2. 2026-05-23 — Risk Assessment

**Problem:** Four risks identified before merge:

| #   | Risk                                                                                          | Severity |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | `extension.ts` doubled in size (1,960 → 3,527 lines, single monolitic file)                   | High     |
| 2   | Zero test coverage on 3 new streaming parsers (Responses, Google, hybrid)                     | High     |
| 3   | Breaking model limit reductions (deepseek-v4-flash-free: 1M→200K ctx, glm-5 output: 131K→32K) | Medium   |
| 4   | No timeout on `models.dev` fetch — could block model registration                             | Low      |

**Action:** Compiled risk assessment with mitigation strategies for each risk.

**Status:** ✅ Assessment complete

### 3. 2026-05-23 — Review Feedback to Wallacy

**Problem:** Needed to communicate concerns before merge.

**Action:** Posted a conversational review comment on PR #4 requesting:

1. Document limit reductions in CHANGELOG `### Changed` section
2. Add `AbortSignal.timeout(10_000)` on `models.dev` fetch
3. Consider splitting `extension.ts` into modules (routing, metadata, errors)
4. Add unit tests for streaming normalizers and routing logic

**Status:** ✅ Feedback sent

### 4. 2026-05-24 — Wallacy Response and Verification

**Problem:** Wallacy pushed updates and needed verification.

**Action:** Fetched latest PR branch. Found 2 new commits:

- `83621b9` — fix: restore command activation and harden routed auth
- `a854ff6` — refactor: split provider metadata and add routing tests

Verified all 4 recommendations addressed:

| #   | Recommendation            | Result                                                                                                         |
| --- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Document breaking changes | ✅ CHANGELOG `### Changed` section added with specific model limit reductions                                  |
| 2   | Fetch timeout             | ✅ `signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000)` added                                                                 |
| 3   | Split into modules        | ✅ `routing.ts` (533 lines), `metadata.ts` (345 lines), `errors.ts` (311 lines), `providerTypes.ts` (12 lines) |
| 4   | Unit tests                | ✅ `test/routing.test.js` with 5 tests covering all normalizers and routing families                           |

Compiled and ran tests: 5/5 pass in 58ms.

**Status:** ✅ All recommendations addressed

### 5. 2026-05-24 — Merge and Missing 0.1.5 Entry

**Problem:** After merging PR #4, discovered CHANGELOG entry for v0.1.5 was missing — jumped from 0.1.4 directly to 0.1.6.

**Root Cause:** PR #4 was branched from a commit before 0.1.5 was pushed to `main`. The 0.1.5 commit (`d0032ed`) existed only in `develop` and was never in the PR #4 diff base.

**Action:** Initially added a fix commit to restore the 0.1.5 entry.

**Status:** ✅ Identified and addressed

### 6. 2026-05-24 — Missing 0.1.5 Code Fixes

**Problem:** Discovered that PR #4 did NOT include the 0.1.5 vision fixes from `develop`:

- `btoa(String.fromCodePoint(...part.data))` stack overflow still present in `extension.ts` line 1830
- `dataPartToBase64()` helper missing
- `messagesHaveImages()` helper missing
- `buildThinkingPayload()` missing `hasImageInput` parameter
- Qwen vision thinking budget skip logic missing

**Action:** Cherry-picked 0.1.5 code fixes into main, resolving 3 merge conflicts (CHANGELOG, package.json, extension.ts).

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 7. 2026-05-24 — Clean Merge via develop

**Problem:** User preferred a clean no-ff merge from `develop` instead of a cherry-pick commit on `main`.

**Action:**

1. Reset main to PR #4 merge commit (`a0d327d`)
2. Merged `main` into `develop` (resolved 3 conflicts, applied 0.1.5 vision fixes on top of PR #4 code)
3. Merged `develop` back into `main` with `--no-ff`

Final git history:

```text
*   d3efa2f  Merge branch 'develop' into main (0.1.5 vision fixes + 0.1.6)
|\
| *   1a1be0a  Merge main (PR #4: 0.1.6) into develop
| * d0032ed  feat: update version to 0.1.5; fix vision request handling
* | a0d327d  Merge pull request #4 from Wallacy
```

**Status:** ✅ Clean merge

### 8. 2026-05-24 — Marketplace Release

**Action:** Compiled, ran tests (5/5 pass), packaged VSIX:

```text
opencode-copilot-chat-0.1.6.vsix (62.41 KB, 18 files)
```

Pushed `main` and `develop` to remote. User uploaded VSIX to marketplace manually.

**Status:** ✅ Released

## Verification

```bash
# Compile
npm run compile

# Tests
node --test test/routing.test.js

# Package
npx vsce package --no-dependencies

# Force push clean main
git push origin main --force-with-lease
git push origin develop
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check if PR branch includes all prior version fixes** — PR #4 was branched before 0.1.5, so vision fixes were missing.
2. **CHANGELOG entries can disappear on merge** — when PR base doesn't include intermediate versions.
3. **Prefer no-ff merge from develop over cherry-pick commits** — cleaner history, single merge commit.
4. **Review feedback works** — Wallacy addressed all 4 recommendations within one update cycle.
