## Overview

Full review and merge cycle for community contributor PR #107 by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP), which adds transient 5xx retry with exponential backoff + jitter to the streaming request path. Covers code review, scope-split request, jitter follow-up, merge plan, and post-merge verification. Complements the existing HTTP 400 retry mechanism documented in [`07-20260615-model-validation-retry.md`](../features/07-20260615-model-validation-retry.md).

## Problem

When the OpenCode gateway momentarily has no healthy backend for a model (router capacity churn, upstream down, restart window), it returns either a classic `502`/`503`/`504` or a `5xx` with a body naming the `Router.Unavailable` condition. Before this PR, the extension surfaced the error to the user immediately on the first failure, even though a second attempt a second later usually succeeds. This produced flaky chat experiences under gateway load, especially during multi-turn agent sessions and parallel tool-call bursts.

---

## Solution

Two coordinated changes, both touching the existing retry module so the two retry families (HTTP 400 degraded-parameter + transient 5xx) share a single mental model:

### 1. `isTransientServerError` classifier (`src/retry.ts`)

A pure function that classifies a failed HTTP response as worth retrying:

- `502`, `503`, `504` are transient by definition (gateway churn, upstream down).
- Other `5xx` are retried **only** when the response body identifies the known momentary condition `Router.Unavailable`. The classifier compacts the body (strips non-letters) and matches `RouterUnavailable` case-insensitively, so JSON shape variations (`{"error":{"type":"Router.Unavailable"}}`, `type: router.unavailable`, etc.) all hit.
- Anything else, including `500`s with unrelated bodies, is treated as permanent so real bugs surface instead of being masked by retries.

```ts
export function isTransientServerError(status: number, errorDetail: string): boolean {
  if (status === 502 || status === 503 || status === 504) {
    return true;
  }
  return status >= 500 && /RouterUnavailable/i.test(compactErrorCode(errorDetail));
}
```

Constants exported for callers and tests:

| Constant                        | Value  | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `TRANSIENT_5XX_MAX_RETRIES`     | `2`    | Hard cap on retries before surfacing the error |
| `TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_BASE_MS`   | `1000` | Base backoff, doubles per attempt (1s, 2s)     |
| `TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_JITTER_MS` | `250`  | Max random jitter added per backoff            |

### 2. Streaming retry loop + cancellation-aware sleep (`src/streaming.ts`)

- `fetchWithBody(body)` helper collapses the three duplicated `fetch(...)` call sites (first attempt, HTTP 400 patched retry, transient 5xx retry) into one closure, so headers/signal/body shape stay in sync.
- After the HTTP 400 retry block, a `while` loop retries up to `TRANSIENT_5XX_MAX_RETRIES` times whenever `isTransientServerError(response.status, consumedErrorBody ?? "")` returns true. Backoff is exponential with jitter:

  ```ts
  const backoffMs = Math.round(TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_BASE_MS * 2 ** (attempt - 1) + Math.random() * TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_JITTER_MS);
  ```

- `sleepWithCancellation(ms, token)` waits for the backoff but aborts early if the user cancels. The cancellation listener is registered **before** `setTimeout` and resolves the promise on fire, so there is no window where a cancellation arrives between `await` resuming and the listener being removed.
- `consumedErrorBody` is reset to `undefined` at the end of the HTTP 400 block and again after every 5xx retry, so the 5xx classifier and the final error handler always read a fresh response body.
- A small UX win in `src/errors.ts`: `describeRouterUnavailable(apiError, fallback)` replaces raw gateway JSON with an actionable hint when the error is `Router.Unavailable` ("OpenCode's router has no healthy backend for this model right now. Retry in a few seconds, or switch to another model."). The request-facing log message keeps the raw detail for debugging.

### 3. Unit tests (`src/test/retry.test.ts`)

Five `node:test` cases for `isTransientServerError`:

1. `502`/`503`/`504` flagged transient.
2. `500` with body naming `Router.Unavailable` flagged transient.
3. `500` with unrelated body treated as permanent.
4. Non-5xx (`429`) treated as permanent.
5. `Router.Unavailable` matched case-insensitively.

## Interaction With the HTTP 400 Retry Path

The two retry families chain in a single request lifecycle:

```text
fetch → 400? → analyzeHttp400ForRetry → patch body → fetch → 5xx? → retry up to 2× (backoff + jitter) → surface error
```

Worst case for one user request is 4 fetches: initial + 1 HTTP 400 patched retry + 2 transient retries. This is **intentional** and was confirmed during review. The `consumedErrorBody` reset at the end of the 400 block ensures the 5xx block reads a fresh body, and the same reset inside the 5xx loop ensures each iteration sees the latest response.

The original submission also bundled a husky + eslint + markdownlint + AGENTS.md + tsconfig stack; per review feedback that stack was split off to PR [#110](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/110) and the standalone `AGENTS.md` was dropped in favor of folding relevant guidance into `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Verification

- `npm run compile` — clean, no TS errors.
- `npm test` — author-claimed 138/138 pass at submission time.
- `npm run test-retry` — E2E retry flow green.
- Code grep on `main` after merge confirms `TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_JITTER_MS`, `isTransientServerError`, `sleepWithCancellation`, `fetchWithBody`, and `describeRouterUnavailable` are all present in their expected files.

Manual live verification against a real `Router.Unavailable` burst was not performed; the classifier is covered by unit tests and the retry loop reuses the existing fetch path.
