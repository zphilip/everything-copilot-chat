## Overview

Top-level and tool-result image attachments are now resized and re-encoded to provider-safe dimensions **before** the final payload guard runs. This mirrors the normalization that the standalone OpenCode CLI applies before forwarding images to the gateway, fixing the long-standing class of `400 Upstream request failed` errors that hit images which were valid pixels but exceeded the gateway's implicit size contract.

Prior to this feature, the extension forwarded raw `Uint8Array` image bytes as base64 data URIs without any transformation. The only defense was a hard raw-byte guard that replaced oversized images with a placeholder text part, which lost the image entirely even when a simple resize would have made it acceptable.

## Problem

### Observed behavior

| Image                                | Before fix                                                                                                                 | After fix                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Small PNG, any dimensions (<1MB raw) | ✅ Sent as-is                                                                                                              | ✅ Passed through unchanged (already in spec)                                              |
| Sub-2MB raw, dimensions >2000px      | ✅ Sent as-is, but `400 Upstream request failed` on some models (e.g. `gpt-5.6-luna`, see issue #94 `payloadBytes=880950`) | ✅ Resized to ≤2000px, re-encoded, sent successfully                                       |
| >2MB raw, any dimensions             | ❌ Replaced with placeholder text part (`MAX_TOP_LEVEL_IMAGE_BYTES`)                                                       | ✅ Resized + re-encoded; only dropped if normalized base64 still exceeds 5MB               |
| Tool-result image (MCP screenshot)   | ✅ Subject to separate `MAX_TOOL_RESULT_IMAGE_BYTES = 1MB` raw guard                                                       | ✅ Normalized first, then same 1MB raw guard still applies for cumulative history bounding |

### Why the raw-byte guard was not enough

The standalone OpenCode CLI normalizes every image before sending: resize to ≤2000×2000, re-encode to PNG/JPEG, cap base64 at 5MB. The extension did not replicate this step, so it sent pixel-faithful data the gateway rejected. The `MAX_TOP_LEVEL_IMAGE_BYTES = 2_000_000` raw guard introduced in issue #38 was a blunt instrument: it protected the gateway from multi-MB payloads by dropping the image, but it could not recover images that were perfectly sendable after a resize.

---

## Implementation

### `src/imageNormalizer.ts` (new)

WASM-based image normalization via `@silvia-odwyer/photon-node` (~2.3MB unpacked, no native deps, cross-platform single artifact).

```typescript
const MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH = 2_000;
const MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT = 2_000;
export const MAX_IMAGE_BASE64_BYTES = 5 * 1024 * 1024;
const JPEG_QUALITIES = [80, 85, 70, 55, 40] as const;
```

Pipeline:

1. Parse base64 data URL. Non-data URLs pass through unchanged.
2. Decode via Photon. If decode fails (malformed image), preserve original.
3. If width ≤2000 AND height ≤2000 AND base64 ≤5MB, return URL unchanged (already in spec).
4. Generate candidate sizes via geometric decay (0.75× per step, capped at 32 steps).
5. For each candidate size: resize with Lanczos3, then try PNG → JPEG (quality 80, 85, 70, 55, 40) in order. Return the first encoding whose base64 ≤5MB.
6. If no candidate fits, return original URL (the final payload guard decides whether to drop it).

### `convertMessage()` changes (`src/extension.ts`)

- `convertMessage()` is now `async` and returns `ConvertedMessageResult { messages, normalizedImageCount }`.
- New closure `normalizeImagePart(part)` runs on **both** image paths:
  - Top-level `LanguageModelDataPart` (user paste/drag): line ~3468
  - Tool-result image inside `LanguageModelToolResultPart`: line ~3405
- Normalization runs **before** the final `MAX_IMAGE_BASE64_BYTES` (5MB) guard. Images that normalize successfully bypass the guard; images whose normalized base64 still exceeds 5MB are replaced with a placeholder text part.

### What was removed

- `MAX_TOP_LEVEL_IMAGE_BYTES = 2_000_000` constant — **deleted**. The raw-byte-only guard is obsolete now that a real normalizer exists.
- The old `normalizeImagePartsInPlace()` post-conversion pass — **deleted**. Normalization is now inline in `convertMessage()` so it composes correctly with the guard.

### What was kept

- `MAX_TOOL_RESULT_IMAGE_BYTES = 1_000_000` (1MB raw) for MCP tool-result images. The normalizer does not bound the cumulative multi-image accumulation case (a long agent loop with many screenshots), so the raw guard still serves its original purpose from issue #34.

### Dependency note

`@silvia-odwyer/photon-node` is a WASM module (not a native binary like `sharp`). It adds ~2.16MB to the packaged VSIX but has no platform-specific builds and no native compilation step. The earlier concern from issue #38 about "sharp/native binary impractical in VS Code extension" does not apply to WASM. Dynamic `import()` is used so the module loads lazily on first image request, not at extension activation.

---

## Configuration

No user-facing settings. Normalization is always on for image attachments. If the Photon module fails to load (corrupt install, WASM runtime issue), the normalizer degrades gracefully: original image data is preserved and the final 5MB base64 guard makes the send/drop decision.
