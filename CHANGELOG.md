# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Everything Copilot Chat** extension — a fork of [opencode-copilot-chat](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat) adding **Volcengine Ark**, **Qianwen AI**, and **Xiaomi MiMo** providers — are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`[Providers]` Fork adds Volcengine Ark + Qianwen AI + Xiaomi MiMo BYOK providers.**
  - **Volcengine Ark** — Volcengine's coding-plan endpoint (OpenAI-compatible), its own `volcengineArk.apiKey`, and a static model list overridable via `volcengineArk.models`.
  - **Qianwen AI** — Alibaba's token-plan MaaS (Qwen models), its own `qianwenai.apiKey`, Anthropic-compatible chat routing (`apps/anthropic/v1/messages`), and a live model list from the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`compatible-mode/v1/models`).
  - **Xiaomi MiMo** — Xiaomi's token-plan MaaS (MiMo models), its own `xiaomimimo.apiKey`, Anthropic-compatible chat routing (`anthropic/v1/messages`), and a live model list from the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`v1/models`).

## [0.7.3] — 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **`[Transport]` HTTP 400 non-recoverable no longer crashes with undici "Body is unusable: Body has already been read" (#199).** The 400-patch loop refactor (0.7.2, review #191) read the error body without caching it; when `analyzeHttp400ForRetry` found nothing recoverable, the `!response.ok` handler re-read the same `Response` and the resulting TypeError swallowed the real 400 detail. Seen on `gpt-5.6-luna` (`/v1/responses`), affects every model/transport that hits a non-recoverable 400. One-line fix caches the read (`consumedErrorBody ??= errorDetail`); regression test in `src/test/engine.test.ts`. Documented in `docs/issues/87-20260828-issue199-400-body-double-read.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` "Try again" error and empty replies on Muse Spark / gpt-5.6-luna — Responses API `finishReason` gap fixed (#197, #198).** `updateRequestUsageSummary` only read `finishReason` from `data.delta.stop_reason` (Anthropic) and `data.choices[0].finish_reason` (chat-completions). Raw Responses API terminal events (`{type:"response.completed",response:{stop_reason:"completed"}}`) have neither field, so `finishReason` was always `undefined` for every Responses stream without `[DONE]`. `isStreamTruncated` sees `undefined` → flags truncated → retries 3× → throws. GPT models survived because the gateway forwards `data:[DONE]`; Muse Spark (upstream Meta) and gpt-5.6-luna do not. Fix (P1): `updateRequestUsageSummary` now treats `response.completed` as a healthy terminal signal and sets `finishReason` from `response.stop_reason ?? "stop"`. Fix (P2): `normalizeResponsesStreamEvent` now handles `response.output_text.done` and `response.output_item.done` (message type) — the events where Muse Spark delivers its actual text instead of streaming deltas — mapping them to `delta.responseDoneText`; `OpenAiResponseExtractor` emits the done-text only when `emittedTextLength === 0`, preventing duplicate output on models (GPT-4o, etc.) that send both streaming deltas and the done snapshot. P1b: `?? "stop"` fallback added to the routing normalizer for defense in depth. 9 new/updated tests. Documented in `docs/issues/86-20260828-issue197-198-responses-api-finish-reason-text-extraction.md`.

- **`[Thinking]` Reasoning is never silently dropped when the `progress` sink is unavailable (#196, Discussion #118).** After the god file split (PR #155), `flushReasoningFallback()` only emitted buffered `reasoning_content` as a `LanguageModelThinkingPart` when both the thinking-part constructor AND a `progress` sink were present at construction time. When the sink was missing (Agents window, certain Copilot Chat contexts) but the constructor was available, the buffered reasoning hit the legacy fallback path and was **silently dropped** — neither in the thinking panel nor as visible text. Fix: a new branch emits the reasoning via `reportProgressPart` with the constructor even without a construction-time sink, and the legacy drop path now logs a warning (`N chars of reasoning dropped`) so silent loss is diagnosable. Adds 3 regression tests in `src/test/extractors.test.ts` asserting the reasoning-surfacing invariants (reasoning → ThinkingPart via progress, never a TextPart, with and without a construction-time sink). Full analysis in `docs/issues/85-20260826-discussion118-deepseek-reasoning-leak-regression-analysis.md` and GitHub issue [#196](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/196).

## [0.7.2] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **`[Streaming]` "Try again" popup no longer appears after content is delivered — applies to all providers, not just Muse Spark (#193).** The #187 fix (Muse Spark) made the engine return success when content was delivered, but only when `hasCompletePendingWork` returned `true`. The `finally` block in every transport adapter already calls `flushRemainingToolCalls()`, which drops incomplete tool calls (arguments cut mid-JSON) without emitting them (#184/#188). Since the transport handles incomplete calls, the engine-level guard was redundant — it falsely triggered a "Try again" error on OpenCode Zen (and any provider whose gateway drops the connection without `[DONE]`/`finish_reason`) after the user had already received their full response. Fix: removed the `hasCompletePendingWork` guard and the unused `hasCompletePendingToolCalls()` method; content-delivered truncation always returns success with a warning log. The `hasCompletePendingWork` option is removed from the engine interface. Documented in `docs/issues/84-20260826-issue193-try-again-zen.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` All whitespace is now preserved in Responses API streams from OpenAI models (#192).** The `firstString()` helper in `normalizeResponsesStreamEvent` called `.trim()` on each `response.output_text.delta` event individually, stripping spaces between words when the caller accumulated the fragments — producing unreadable concatenated text like `thisiswhattheresponselookslike`. A new `firstStringRaw()` helper (without `.trim()`) is now used for text and reasoning deltas, while `firstString()` (with `.trim()`) stays for non-text fields (`call_id`, `stop_reason`, `arguments_delta`) where whitespace stripping is correct. Documented in `docs/issues/83-20260826-responses-api-whitespace-stripped.md`.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-08-26

- **`[Retry]` Generic `[1210] invalid input` 400s now self-heal by degrading optional parameters (#190).** New models sometimes reject parameters the extension always sends (`stream_options`, `temperature`, data-URL images) without naming the offender. The HTTP-400 retry classifier gained `patchInvalidInput`: on that error shape it strips one optional parameter per attempt in least-likely-to-matter order, so the request adapts instead of hard-failing. Once nothing optional remains, real failures surface unchanged. Documented in `docs/issues/81-20260823-issue190-1210-invalid-input-degradation.md`.

### Fixed

- **`[Streaming]` Incomplete tool calls from truncated streams are now dropped instead of executing with corrupted input (#184).** When a `[DONE]`-less stream cuts tool-call arguments mid-JSON, `flushRemainingToolCalls` drops incomplete pending calls instead of emitting them. Documented in `docs/issues/80-20260823-issue184-incomplete-toolcall-guard.md`.

- **`[Models]` Muse Spark 1.2 variants now included in offline vision fallback (#183).** `muse-spark-1.2-contributor` and `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free` were missing from the bundled fallback vision-capable model list, so image attachments were silently dropped when the models.dev fetch failed. Documented in `docs/issues/82-20260826-issue183-muse-vision-fallback.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` Muse Spark no longer throws "stream ended before completion" after delivering content (#178 regression).** The truncated-stream detector from #178 flags streams that end without `[DONE]` or `finish_reason`. Muse Spark on the Responses API delivers content (text, tool calls) but closes the connection without either signal — a gateway quirk, not a failure. The engine now logs a warning and returns successfully when content was already delivered, instead of throwing an error popup on an otherwise complete response. This fix is now superseded by the broader fix in #193. Documented in `docs/issues/79-20260822-issue-muse-spark-stream-completion.md`.

- **`[Models]` Deprecated filter no longer hides live models (#182).** `models.dev` `status: deprecated` was hiding models still served by the gateway (e.g. `laguna-s-2.1-free`). The filter now cross-checks against the live gateway response — only hides when `models.dev` says deprecated AND the gateway confirms the model is absent. Note: `deepseek-v4-flash-free` is listed by the gateway but actually broken upstream ("Model is unavailable") — this is an upstream issue, not solvable from the extension side. Documented in `docs/issues/78-20260822-issue182-deprecated-model-gateway-crosscheck.md`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-22

### Added

- **`[Models]` Muse Spark 1.2 support.** Full support for `muse-spark-1.2-contributor` (Go) and `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free` (Zen). Muse models are routed through the Responses API with `truncation: disabled` and tool names truncated to 64 characters (both gateway constraints). A new `MuseThinking` strategy provides configurable thinking effort (off/low/medium/high/xhigh) via `reasoning: { effort }`, and the thinking effort picker now includes a Muse Spark entry. Fallback metadata provides 1M context / 131K output limits when the live models.dev fetch is unavailable.

- **`[Thinking]` OpenAI thinking effort setting.** New `opencodego.thinking.openai` setting exposes the OpenAI/GPT reasoning effort (`off` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh`), mapped to the Responses API `reasoning.effort` field. Documented in `docs/features/02-20260517-per-model-thinking-controls.md`.

- **`[Providers]` Configurable API base URL.** The extension no longer hardcodes the `opencode.ai` endpoints — it can now point at any compatible gateway via `opencodego.apiBaseUrl` (default `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`) and `opencodezen.apiBaseUrl` (default `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`). The extension derives the `/chat/completions`, `/messages`, `/responses`, `/models`, and (Go only) `/usage` routes from the configured base and applies them to every provider (normal chat, Agents window variants, inline completions, usage sync). Custom URLs are normalized and validated — non-`http(s)`, embedded credentials, query strings, and hashes are rejected and fall back to the default. Reload the window after changing the setting. Unit tests added for URL normalization and route construction.

---

### Changed

- **`[Providers]` Configurable API base URL.** The extension no longer hardcodes the `opencode.ai` endpoints — it can now point at any compatible gateway via `opencodego.apiBaseUrl` (default `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`) and `opencodezen.apiBaseUrl` (default `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`). The extension derives the `/chat/completions`, `/messages`, `/responses`, `/models`, and (Go only) `/usage` routes from the configured base and applies them to every provider (normal chat, Agents window variants, inline completions, usage sync). Custom URLs are normalized and validated — non-`http(s)`, embedded credentials, query strings, and hashes are rejected and fall back to the default. Reload the window after changing the setting. Unit tests added for URL normalization and route construction.

- **`[Internal]` API keys are configured through the BYOK panel only.** The `OpenCode Go: Set API Key` / `OpenCode Zen: Set API Key` commands and the "Set / Clear API Key" menu items inside `Manage Provider` are removed — keys are entered once via **Chat: Manage Language Models → "+ Add Models"** (the native BYOK flow). `SecretStorage` is no longer a user-facing entry point; it stays as an internal per-vendor mirror (`opencodego.apiKey` / `opencodezen.apiKey`) that the BYOK resolution writes so agent-host variants and cold-start requests inherit the group key. Splitting the secret per vendor also fixes a latent collision where Go and Zen shared a single `opencodego.apiKey` and overwrote each other's key. `Refresh Models` / `Test Connection` now point at the BYOK flow when no key is configured instead of prompting for one.

- **`[Internal]` Per-provider Thinking strategy classes + single config authority.** The thinking/reasoning system is refactored from one monolithic builder into a per-provider strategy (`src/thinking/`): an interface + factory (`provider.ts`), a shared base class, and one class per model family (`deepseek`, `glm`, `kimi`, `minimax`, `openai`, `qwen`, `mimo`, `fallback`). Each provider now owns its reasoning picker schema, its request-payload mapping, and whether its `reasoning_content` is surfaced as chat content. Configuration resolves from a **single authority** — the VS Code per-model configuration (model picker / Manage), with workspace settings and per-family defaults as fallbacks — instead of competing sources (workspace + modelConfiguration + a `globalState` shadow copy + defaults). The shadow copy is removed, so a thinking effort chosen for one model can no longer silently leak onto another model or override an explicit "Off". Model IDs are normalized to `effectiveModelId` (the `::sk-***` fp suffix is gone), which also stops the per-model settings group from being recreated on every pick. Request builders are split out of `extension.ts` into per-endpoint modules (`src/request/{types,schema,shared,openai,anthropic,google}.ts`). Windows tooling fixes: `scripts/lint.ts` runs npm `.cmd` shims through the shell and a new `.gitattributes` enforces LF normalization, so `npm run lint` (prettier + shellcheck) is green on Windows; `scripts/staged-lint.ts` and `isCwdInWorkspace` get the same treatment.

- **`[Internal]` God files split into domain modules (no behavior change).** The three monolithic files — `src/extension.ts` (4653 lines), `src/streaming.ts` (1620) and `src/goUsageTracker.ts` (1510) — are split into domain folders:
  - `src/usage/` — Go usage domain: `tracker.ts`, `history.ts` (OpenCode CLI SQLite read/aggregation), `pricing.ts`, `formatting.ts`, `dashboard.ts` (status bar + usage webview incl. the HTML template + tooltip SVG), plus the moved `usage.ts` / `usageProfile.ts` / `goUsageSync.ts`.
  - `src/transports/` — one file per transport (`chatCompletions`, `responses`, `anthropic`, `google`) plus the shared streaming `engine`, pure `sse` parser, `extractors`, `extract` helpers and `thinkTags` filter; the transport contract types live in `src/core/transport.ts` (routing in `src/core/routing.ts`).
  - `src/provider/` — `OpenCodeProvider` class, `definitions` (PROVIDERS table + model types), `messages`/`tokens` (message conversion + token estimation), `settings` (schema/getSettings/limits/capabilities), `visionProxy`.
  - `src/models/` — `metadata`, `modelLimits`, `modelCapabilities`, `modelNames`, `pricing`, `metadataFetcher` (models.dev cache).
  - `src/commands/` — provider, agent-window, diagnostics and thinking-picker command handlers; `src/request/headers.ts` for the OpenCode request headers.
- **`[Internal]` Remaining oversized files split to enforce the ≤600-line limit (no behavior change).** `src/provider/OpenCodeProvider.ts` (1259 lines) now delegates to `chatPrep.ts` (request preparation: message conversion, vision proxy, history trimming, budgets), `modelInfo.ts` (`provideLanguageModelChatInformation` assembly), `modelList.ts` (`ModelListFetcher` with retry/cache), `transportLog.ts` (`TransportSummaryLog`), `providerDialogs.ts` (Manage/Test Connection flows) and `providerUtils.ts`; the class itself is 584 lines. `src/usage/tracker.ts` is split into `trackerTypes.ts`, `trackerWindows.ts` and `trackerSummary.ts` (pure summary builders taking an injected context). The goUsageTracker tests are split into focused suites sharing `src/test/helpers/goUsageTestUtils.ts`.
  - `extension.ts` is now a thin entry (~400 lines) that only wires activation + command registration. The two compat barrels (`streaming.ts`, `goUsageTracker.ts`) are removed and every importer references canonical paths. All behavior-preserving — verified by `npm run compile` + 291 unit tests + mock-server retry E2E (`npm run test-retry`) + `npm run lint`.

- **`[Internal]` Data-driven model registry (`src/core/registry.ts`).** The transport router and the thinking-family detector previously each owned a hardcoded model-prefix table. Both now read ONE data-driven table: `MODEL_REGISTRY` rows map model-family patterns → `{ endpointKind, sdkPackage, thinkingFamily, vendors? }`. `resolveModelRouting()` honors per-vendor restrictions (e.g. MiniMax `m2.x` → Messages on Go, Gemini → Google on Zen); `thinkingFamily()` reads the same table vendor-agnostically. Adding a new model family = adding one row (+ optionally a thinking strategy class). Context limits / capabilities stay metadata-driven (live models.dev) rather than duplicated in a static table. Behavior-preserving — verified by 14 new registry tests (305 total).

### Fixed

- **`[Tools]` Incomplete tool calls from truncated streams are dropped, not executed (#184).** #187 made content-delivered streams without `[DONE]`/`finish_reason` return successfully — but a stream cut mid-tool-call-arguments then flushed a `LanguageModelToolCallPart` whose truncated JSON silently coerced to `{}`, executing the tool with corrupted input. `flushRemainingToolCalls` now drops incomplete pending calls (empty args = complete, per gateway convention for no-param tools; non-empty invalid JSON = truncated), and the engine throws the truncation error instead of returning success when the Responses adapter reports incomplete pending work. Documented in `docs/issues/80-20260823-issue184-incomplete-toolcall-guard.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` Truncation / idle-stall retries are now a bounded loop of 3 attempts (#181).** When the gateway drops the connection before any content is emitted, the engine retries up to `STREAM_FAILURE_MAX_RETRIES` times (was a single retry) so flaky models like Ox Alpha Stealth and GPT 5.6 Luna self-heal instead of erroring every turn. The retry stays gated on zero emitted parts, so it can never duplicate chat content. Documented in `docs/issues/78-20260822-ox-alpha-truncation-retry.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` Idle-stalled streams before first content are retried too (#179).** The pre-content one-shot stream retry from #178 now also covers the 2-minute idle-guard abort (`stalled-retry` summary; both failure modes share a single retry budget via the renamed `isStreamFailureRetry` flag — worst case exactly one extra attempt, never two). The stall error now points users at `streamIdleTimeoutSeconds` for models with long silent reasoning pauses. Documented in `docs/issues/77-20260822-stream-stall-resilience.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` Truncated streams before first content are retried; byte-only dead streams no longer succeed silently (#177).** `isStreamTruncated` required extracted content, so a `[DONE]`-transport stream that received bytes but ended with no `[DONE]`, no `finish_reason`, and zero extractable parts was treated as success — an empty reply with no error. The gate is dropped (bytes + missing terminator = abnormal), and the engine now transparently retries such a request once (`truncated-retry` summary, internal flag — safe because nothing was reported to VS Code, so no duplicated chat text). Content-emitting truncations still fail with the clear error from #170, which now also carries the `x-opencode-request` id for support correlation. Documented in `docs/issues/76-20260822-truncated-stream-resilience.md`.

- **`[Responses]` Muse Spark context window now updates correctly.** The Responses API nests usage under `response.usage` on the `response.completed` event, but the usage parser only checked top-level `usage` — so prompt, completion, total, and cached tokens were silently dropped for Muse Spark, keeping the Copilot Chat context window at 0%. The parser now falls back to `response.usage` and also reads `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens` alongside the existing OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` field. Three unit tests added covering the Responses nested shape, top-level precedence, and the existing OpenAI shape.

- **`[Chat]` Streams no longer end silently when the gateway drops the connection mid-response.** A chat could appear to "stop working" with no error: the engine only ended a stream on connection close or user cancellation, so (a) a gateway that kept the connection alive after its `data: [DONE]` terminator left the request hanging until the 2-minute idle timeout (user manually cancelled → silent), and (b) a connection that closed _without_ `[DONE]` (proxy reset, upstream crash, truncated payload) was treated as a successful empty response. `parseServerSentEvent` (`src/transports/sse.ts`) now fires an `onDone` callback on `data: [DONE]` and the engine breaks the read loop immediately on it (prompt completion instead of waiting on a lingering socket); a new `isStreamTruncated` check throws a clear `OpenCodeRequestError` ("stopped sending data before the response was complete… try again / check your connection, VPN, or firewall") when the stream closed with neither `[DONE]` nor a captured `finish_reason` after content was already received. Unit tests added in `src/test/sse.test.ts`.

- **`[Chat]` Vision payloads no longer trigger futile history trimming (#173).** Base64 image data was counted toward the 512 KB `MAX_REQUEST_PAYLOAD_BYTES` ceiling, so a payload carrying the images that survived image trimming (up to ~5 MB base64 each) sat above the cap no matter what — the text-history trimmer then dropped the whole middle conversation for nothing and still reported over-cap. Byte accounting now strips oversized data URLs down to an `[image]` placeholder before measuring (`stripImageData` in `src/provider/historyTrim.ts`): image weight stays the image trimmer's job, structure overhead stays counted so the estimate never under-trims, and text-only payloads measure exactly as before. Documented in `docs/issues/75-20260821-issue173-vision-byte-cap.md`.

- **`[Internal]` Bug-hunt pass — 35 latent fixes across streaming, usage, providers, models and tooling (PR #157).** Highlights: a real webview crash (`esc()` undefined in the usage Models tab), the 5xx `Router.Unavailable` retry that never fired (body-match input only set on the 400 path), cancel-during-backoff surfacing a stale 5xx error, usage day bucketing off-by-one (`Math.round` → `Math.floor`), the active usage profile being overridden every ~300 ms by an unconditional `ensureProfileSync` (breaking multi-key setups), reasoning dropped without a progress sink, phantom tokens from the reasoning-history marker, a stale-token race in the completion debouncer, and staged-lint/request-schema hardening (+93-line schema test suite). Independently reviewed pre-merge (tsc clean, 324/324 tests, live gateway check); two PR-body discrepancies were corrected by the contributor before merge. Documented in `docs/issues/74-20260821-pr157-bug-hunt-pass-35-fixes.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` Blank code boxes during subagent runs.** `<think>` tags in streamed content rendered as blank code blocks in the chat UI when a subagent (tool-calling invocation) was running, flooding the chat. Think-tag stripping is now **forced** whenever tools are present in the request (`options.tools.length > 0`) — trigger is tool-call detection, not model-specific, and `ThinkTagFilter` stays a no-op for models that don't emit think tags. Documented in `docs/issues/72-20260821-pr164-force-think-tag-stripping-subagents.md`.

- **`[Chat]` Stale completion limits self-heal instead of failing with HTTP 400 (#171).** OpenCode Go now enforces per-model completion caps that models.dev does not yet reflect, so `deepseek-v4-flash` requests failed outright with `max_tokens is too large: 384000. This model supports at most 131072 completion tokens.` The HTTP-400 retry classifier gained a `patchMaxTokensCap` pattern: when the gateway reports the cap in its error, the output budget (`max_tokens` / `max_output_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens`, or nested `generationConfig.maxOutputTokens`) is clamped to the reported value and the request retried once — for any model whose upstream cap shrinks, not just this one. The bundled fallback metadata for `deepseek-v4-flash` is also corrected to `131072` so offline resolution does not send the rejected value. Unit tests cover the exact error text, formatted counts, Responses/Google budget shapes, and the no-op cases.

- **`[Thinking]` Sampling-level `repetition_penalty` for MiMo curbs infinite thinking loops (#36).** A `repetition_penalty: 1.2` is now applied unconditionally in every MiMo payload (regardless of reasoning effort) to suppress the degenerate token-repeat pattern that triggered the Go gateway's infinite-loop detector upstream. This is a third mitigation layer alongside the `budget_tokens` cap and suffix-repetition stream detection shipped earlier. Applies with reasoning off (where the loop fires less often) and on; does not trip `bodyRequestsThinking()` so the gateway workaround path is unaffected.

- **DeepSeek / Mimo thinking content no longer leaks into the chat transcript.** `treatReasoningAsContent` was mis-detecting native-reasoning families as "no reasoning in body" and echoing their `reasoning_content` as plain chat text. The decision now comes from the provider strategy (always `false` for DeepSeek and Mimo), so chain-of-thought stays in the thinking panel.

- **`[Thinking]` GLM 5.3+ can no longer be disabled (HTTP 400, #162).** GLM 5.3 and later reject `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` with _"This model always engages in thinking and cannot be disabled; please use low, high, or max"_. `GlmThinking` now detects GLM 5.3+ by version and forces thinking on (default `high`; the picker exposes only `high`/`max` and hides `off`), mirroring the Kimi K2.7-code force-on fix. A defensive retry pattern in `retry.ts` also strips `thinking` when the upstream reports it cannot be disabled, so any stale cached `off` is recovered automatically. Unit tests added for version detection, forced-on resolution, payload shape and picker schema.
- **`[Chat]` Conversation history is now bounded to fit the model context window and a payload ceiling that scales with the window.** Long multi-turn conversations (or many repeated turns without running Compact Conversation) could grow past the model's context limit, so the upstream rejected the oversized request (HTTP 400/503 "Endpoint is unavailable", `payloadBytes` ≈ 783 KB), returned an empty stream (VS Code: "No response came" / "Sorry, no response was returned"), or hung until the 10-minute request timeout. `trimOldMessagesToFitContext` now drops the oldest messages on **two** axes — a token budget capped at `HISTORY_TRIM_TARGET_RATIO = 0.7` of the context window (so we stay below the ~70%-full failure threshold the reporter hit, not just under the raw window) **and** a byte ceiling `historyByteCapForBudget(inputBudget) = max(512 KB, inputBudget × HISTORY_BYTES_PER_TOKEN)` that scales with the context window (512 KB floor for small windows, ~3.3 MB for 1M windows) so large-context models are not clamped to ~13% (~128K tokens). It runs in **O(n)** (estimate once, subtract per dropped unit) instead of the previous O(n²) whole-payload re-estimation that caused the per-request session slowness, drops complete tool-call groups as one unit (never orphaning a reference), preserves the anchor and current prompt, and returns `{ removed, finalTokens, finalBytes }` so the caller skips a second re-estimation. Unit tests extended in `src/test/messages.test.ts` (byte-cap scaling, floor, tool-group dropping, returned estimates, anchor/prompt preservation).

- **`[Chat]` Chat requests now retry transient network failures (`fetch failed`).** A `fetch()` that _throws_ (undici `TypeError: fetch failed` — `ECONNRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, socket reuse races per [`nodejs/undici#5450`](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/5450)) was never retried on the chat path, so a single transient socket blip surfaced directly to the user as a hard "Sorry, your request failed. Please try again." — even though the same class of failure is already retried for the model-list fetch (issue #78). `streamOpenCodeResponse` now wraps every `fetch()` call in `fetchWithTransientRetry`, which retries up to `TRANSIENT_FETCH_MAX_RETRIES = 3` times with exponential backoff (500 ms / 1 s / 2 s, jittered) on transient errors only — never on `AbortError` from cancellation or our own request/stream timeout, and never on HTTP 4xx. On exhaustion it throws a clear, actionable `OpenCodeRequestError` ("couldn't reach the gateway (network error). Check your connection, VPN, or firewall") instead of the raw undici wrapper. The shared classifier `isTransientFetchError` is moved from `provider/definitions.ts` to `retry.ts` (the retry-decision module) so both the chat path and the model-list path use one source of truth; `definitions.ts` re-exports it. Unit tests added in `src/test/retry.test.ts`.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added

- **`[Autocomplete]` Chat-prompt suggestions are now opt-in.** VS Code exposes the Copilot Chat prompt box as a virtual `chatSessionInput` document, and the `"**"` provider selector matched it — so ghost text appeared while writing prompts. The provider now only serves real editable code surfaces (`isCompletionDocument` — a code-editor scheme allowlist, so future interactive surfaces are excluded automatically) with an opt-in carve-out for the chat prompt via `opencodego.inlineSuggestionsChatInput`.

- **`[Autocomplete]` Known limitation (follow-up planned):** inline-completion requests are not yet wired into the Go usage tracker's cost accounting (`tracker.record()` only runs in the chat provider path). The panel does track **Suggested / Approved** counts per day (see the usage dashboard entry), but the USD cost of completions is not attributed until a follow-up ships the transport summary from the completion engine. This is tracked as a documented TODO on #136/#138 rather than an oversight.

- **`[Autocomplete]` Inline code suggestions (experimental, #49).** Ghost-text completions while typing, powered by the OpenCode gateway with thinking forced off. Opt-in via `opencodego.inlineSuggestions` (default `false`); model via `opencodego.inlineSuggestionsModel` (default `qwen3.5-plus`, whose `enable_thinking=false` mode is a genuine no-reasoning path — measured ~1.5s time-to-first-token with zero hidden reasoning). Requests are tiny (10 lines before the cursor + a short suffix), debounced 300ms, time out at 3s and abort on the next keystroke. The gateway exposes no FIM endpoint, so completions emulate fill-in-the-middle with FIM tokens over `/chat/completions`. New `src/autocomplete/` module (context, prompt, throttle, engine, provider, registration) with unit tests; `scripts/probe-completion-latency.ts` measures engine latency live. All timing/size knobs are user-tunable: `inlineSuggestionsDebounceMs`, `inlineSuggestionsTimeoutMs`, `inlineSuggestionsMaxTokens`, `inlineSuggestionsPrefixLines`, `inlineSuggestionsSuffixChars`.
- **`[Usage]` Server-accurate Go meters via the official `/zen/go/v1/usage` endpoint (#130).** The status bar, tooltip, quick-pick and usage webview previously showed locally estimated Session/Weekly/Monthly percentages that drifted from opencode.ai (issue #23) because they missed CLI, cross-device and pre-install usage. The tracker now pulls the official endpoint (upstream anomalyco/opencode#16513, verified live) with the existing Go key on startup and after each request (60s TTL cache): rolling/weekly/monthly percent + reset times are server-computed and account-wide, `spent` is derived from the authoritative percent, and Today/Yesterday + per-session spend stay device-local. Failures (401/403/404/network) fall back to the existing SQLite → tracked estimates. The key is only ever sent as the Authorization header and never logged or persisted. New pure module `src/goUsageSync.ts` with unit tests. Documented in `docs/issues/62-20260812-pr132-go-usage-server-sync.md`.

### Changed

- **`[Internal]` Central configuration + shared utilities (no behavior change).** Every tunable value in the codebase — URLs, timeouts, limits, storage keys, setting keys and defaults — now lives in one dependency-free module `src/config.ts`, so future tuning happens in a single file. Existing modules import from it and re-export the names their callers rely on. A new pure `src/utils.ts` replaces the near-identical helpers that were copy-pasted across modules: `isRecord` (was defined 6×), `firstString`, `compactErrorCode`, `positiveNumber`, `getErrorMessage`, `formatUsd`, `formatTokenCount`, `formatRelativeTime`, `escapeHtml` and the two cancellable delay variants. Dead code removed: `getOrCreateProfile`, `formatGoUsageTooltip`, `formatGoUsageLanguageStatusDetail`, `createUsageDataPart`. Both stream extractors (`OpenAiResponseExtractor`, `AnthropicResponseExtractor`) now share a `BaseResponseExtractor` instead of duplicating reasoning accounting and think-tag filtering. The verification scripts (`verify-estimate-token-count`, `validate-models`) import the real production logic instead of drifted copies. Sanity tests added for the new modules (`utils.test.ts`, `config.test.ts`, 235 unit tests total). Documented in `docs/issues/66-20260813-pr138-central-config-utils-usage-dashboard.md`; usage dashboard living reference `docs/features/16-20260813-usage-dashboard-realtime.md`. PR [#138](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/138) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).
- **`[Tooling]` Strict-but-sane lint stack + intelligent pre-commit gate (PR #129).** ESLint keeps the type-aware rules that catch real bugs (`strict` + `strictTypeChecked`: `no-unsafe-*`, `no-unnecessary-condition`, `no-floating-promises`) and drops the pure-`stylistic` layer that fought prettier. `npm run lint` / `bun lint` now ends with a Tests step (compile + unit tests), making it the single "is everything green" command. A new intelligent pre-commit gate (`scripts/staged-lint.ts`, `npm run lint:staged`) lints staged files **plus their direct import dependents** (resolved from the real import graph) instead of either the whole tree (slow) or only the staged files (blind) — so changing a module can never leave type-aware errors in its consumers. Measured: config-only commit ≈1s, `src/` commit ≈10s; full-tree lint stays in CI. Branch also carries the unified `scripts/lint.ts`/`format.ts` runners, `editorconfig-checker` + `shellcheck` + `tsconfig.check.json` type-check (covers `scripts/`, which the build tsconfig never did), script renames (`*.mjs`/`*.mts` → `*.ts`), eslint 10.8.1 + `@types/node` 26.2 (supersedes dependabot #91), and husky PATH fixes. Post-review refinements (5 commits): all 217 `void describe/it/test` prefixes dropped from test files (`22e04b7`), `@ts-expect-error` allowed for proposed-API workarounds while `@ts-ignore` stays banned (`5246434`), repo moved to TypeScript-first config (`eslint.config.ts`, typed scripts via `tsx`, `76570cc`) and standard extensions (`514a63f`), markdownlint config renamed to `.json` (`c817871`). Documented in `docs/issues/61-20260812-pr129-strict-lint-stack-precommit-gate.md`. PR [#129](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/129) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).

### Fixed

- **`[Usage]` Token counting now includes cached tokens — Codebase/Today/Yesterday totals were massively undercounted.** The CLI's per-message `tokens.input` EXCLUDES cache reads, and the sum used for the charts and rows (`input + output + reasoning`) dropped `cache.read` entirely. DeepSeek V4 sessions routinely carry ~700K cached prompt tokens per message, so the displayed totals were ~99% short. Every counting site (`sumDailyUsage`, `buildUsageSeries`, `codebaseUsage`) now uses the full total `input + output + reasoning + cache.read`, verified to match the DB's authoritative `tokens.total`. Requests and costs were already correct (1 per assistant message; cost from the CLI's own per-message field, extension-side billing via billable = prompt − cached).
- **`[Usage]` DeepSeek V4 reasoning no longer leaks into visible text.** With thinking "off" the DeepSeek V4 family still produces genuine chain-of-thought (only the effort parameter is omitted), so the Go-gateway "thinking-off" workaround (#37635) misclassified it as content and printed it as visible text. `reasoning_content` from reasoning-first models now always lands in the thinking block; the workaround stays scoped to models that genuinely stop reasoning when no effort is sent (verified case: MiMo). Dead branches removed around the same logic (redundant `isGoGateway` wrapper and the implied-empty `!visible` check).

- **`[Usage]` SQLite reads no longer depend on the `sqlite3` binary.** The zero-usage mystery was the Android SDK's `sqlite3` (`~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/sqlite3`) being on the PATH only when VS Code launches from a shell that exports it — desktop-launched windows silently lost all CLI history (Today/Yesterday/Codebase = 0 while the fetched quota kept working). The CLI history is now read through Node's built-in `node:sqlite` first (zero external dependencies, retried twice on busy WAL states), falling back to the `sqlite3` binary resolved from PATH **plus** known locations (system, Homebrew, Android SDK). Failures are logged with the exact error to the "OpenCode Go Usage" output channel.

- **`[Usage]` Panel polish + chat-completion charts.** Hovering anywhere on a chart (not just on points) highlights the nearest day with a guide line + dots and a cursor-follow tooltip; on the Models tab the tooltip lists every model's spend for that day. Two new tabs — **Suggested** and **Approved** — chart inline chat completions with whole-number axes and honest tooltips (the day's suggestion/approval counts, not chat token totals); both series share the exact same day buckets, so hovers never resolve to undefined. Acceptances are detected with a bounded heuristic: VS Code's stable API exposes no inline-completion acceptance event, so committing a ghost text is recognized by the document insert starting exactly at the suggested position with a matching multi-character text (30s window, cleared on first match — see `matchesAcceptance`). The default chart window is **Lifetime**, switchable live via the **Window** button (Week → 14 days → Month → Lifetime). The panel brand shows only the profile name, the legend swatches are square and text-aligned, and axes keep round equal tick steps.

- **`[Usage]` Full-page usage panel.** The usage webview is now a complete dashboard (inspired by the reference page): subscription meters as animated rings, stat chips for Today / Yesterday / Codebase, an interactive chart area with Spend / Requests / Tokens tabs (all line charts) and a By-model tab (overlapping colored line charts per model by spend, with a legend and hover tooltips for the model · day · spend/tokens/requests breakdown). Data follows the cursor with a tooltip on every chart element. Chart window: `opencodego.usageChartDays` (default 14 days). The all-time workspace row is labeled **Codebase** everywhere (panel, quick-pick, status-bar tooltip); the old "Top model" / "Models used" chips are gone. Styled action buttons sit in the panel's top-right corner: **Set targets**, **Rename** (when multiple profiles exist) and **Refresh** — wired through `vscode.postMessage`, and a refresh keeps the active tab (data is pushed in place, the page is never reloaded; the background loop still runs at `usageRefreshIntervalSeconds`). Chart axes use round tick steps (1/2/2.5/5 × 10ⁿ) so gaps are always equal and clean (no more 1.25/2.50/3.75 divisions). See the usage dashboard living reference `docs/features/16-20260813-usage-dashboard-realtime.md`.

- **`[Usage]` Realtime updates.** The status bar, tooltip and usage panel now refresh on a configurable background cadence (`opencodego.usageRefreshIntervalSeconds`, default 60s, min 5s), so terminal-side OpenCode CLI usage, server meters and midnight day rollovers appear without waiting for the next chat request. Changing any usage-view setting repaints the UI immediately, and the refresh interval itself applies live on the next tick.

- **`[Usage]` Instant startup + no more slow usage reads.** The last successful server-usage snapshot is now persisted (`opencodego.serverUsage.v1`) and restored on window start, so the status bar / tooltip render real meters immediately instead of 0s until the network refetch lands (the TTL-guarded refresh still runs in the background). The CLI database read — a blocking `sqlite3` call over a multi-GB file — is memoized for 3 seconds, so a burst of UI refreshes (status bar + tooltip + panel) pays the query cost once.

- **`[Usage]` Compact number formatting everywhere.** Token AND request counts render as `1.2T` / `1.2B` / `1.2M` / `12k` (with correct unit escalation at rounding boundaries — no more `1000.0M`), and dollars as `$1.23M` / `$1.50K` / `$12.30` with sub-cent precision (`$0.0004`) so tiny spend never collapses to `$0.00`. Applied to the status-bar tooltip, tooltip card, quick-pick and usage panel.

- **`[Usage]` Today/Yesterday now merge the OpenCode CLI history with extension-tracked usage.** The CLI database (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`) stores per-message `cost` + `tokens.{input,output,reasoning,cache}` + `path.cwd` + timestamps, so users who also run OpenCode in the terminal get their real combined daily totals (terminal + VS Code) instead of VS Code-only estimates. Configurable via `opencodego.usageTodayYesterdaySource` (`auto` / `cli` / `extension`).
- **`[Usage]` New "Codebase" row replaces the old "Session (est)" estimate.** Shows all-time usage for the CURRENT workspace (matched per-directory from the CLI history `path.cwd`), forever by default (`opencodego.usageCodebaseWindowDays`, 0 = all history). Toggle with `opencodego.usageCodebaseRow`.
- **`[Usage]` Local tracked data is permanent.** The "Reset tracked usage data" action is removed and the 31-day entry cutoff is gone (only the hard 2000-entry cap applies) — the data today/yesterday/codebase rely on can no longer be deleted or silently expire.
- **`[Usage]` New display options:** `opencodego.usageRollingSessionMeter` (hide the server 5-hour rolling meter in detailed views) and `opencodego.usageDayBoundary` (`utc` / `local` midnight for the Today/Yesterday rows).

- **`[Internal]` `sanitizeToolSchema` emitted `type: "object"` via a ternary whose branches were identical** — collapsed to the constant.
- **`[Internal]` Anthropic stream extractor wrote usage fields onto itself** instead of the request summary — the real summary was already updated by the SSE data callback, so the duplicate (and wrong-object) write is gone.
- **`[Internal]` `formatModalityBadges` duplicated its Audio branch** under two conditions that covered all cases — collapsed.
- **`[Internal]` `formatRelativeTime` rendered 26h as `26h`** instead of `1d 2h` — the days branch now takes precedence.
- **`[Internal]` Debouncer ignored debounce-window config changes until the provider was recreated** — a pending run is now rescheduled when `delayMs` changes, so `opencodego.inlineSuggestionsDebounceMs` applies on the very next keystroke.
- **`[Internal]` Numeric settings sanitized** — a misconfigured string `temperature`/`maxTokens`/timeout value can no longer reach the request body (was a potential HTTP 400 upstream).
- **`[Internal]` `resolveModelMetadata` ignored the bundled `temperature: false` fallback** — kimi-k2.7-code sent an unsupported `temperature` on cold start / failed models.dev fetch and depended on the runtime 400-retry to save every request. The fallback chain now includes the bundled value.
- **`[Internal]` Modality-based vision detection treated any non-text modality as vision** — an audio/pdf/video-only model advertised `imageInput: true`, so VS Code forwarded image attachments the model cannot process. Vision now requires an actual image modality.
- **`[Internal]` The Zen `freeOnly` model filter was only applied on the live fetch path** — when the model-list fetch failed (or was cancelled), the bundled/cached fallback list could show paid models to free-only users. The filter now applies on every path.
- **`[Internal]` The Go-gateway "thinking off" workaround misfired for Kimi K2.7 / MiniMax M3** — those route through chat-completions with an Anthropic-style `thinking` block, which the detector didn't recognize, so genuine chain-of-thought was emitted as visible text. Detection now covers every reasoning channel (`bodyRequestsThinking()`).
- **`[Internal]` `setManualSpentTargets` over-counted re-edited monthly targets on the SQLite path** — the raw-SQLite monthly sum never contains the baseline, so subtracting it (meant for the summary fallback) inflated the manual target (target $60 with $12 raw spend produced a $72 baseline).
- **`[Internal]` `buildSummaryFromRows` reported `sqliteAvailable: false`** for SQLite-backed summaries (only masked by the enriched builder overriding it).
- **`[Internal]` Error classification hardened against hosts without a global `DOMException`.**

- **`[Provider]` Duplicate OpenCode Go/Zen models after setting a per-model option (e.g. `reasoningEffort`) in the model picker (#131).** Setting a per-model option makes VS Code write a settings-only group (no `apiKey`) into `chatLanguageModels.json`; VS Code then resolves that group with `configuration: {}`, and the SecretStorage fallback ran on both the groupless call and the group call, serving every model twice (7 → 14 in the report). A group call whose `configuration` is present but carries no API key is now treated as a per-model configuration group and returns `[]`, leaving the groupless call as the single source. Per-model settings still apply at request time via `modelConfiguration`. Documented in `docs/issues/64-20260813-issue131-permodel-config-duplicate-models.md`.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-08-11

### Added

- **`[Vision]` Vision proxy description cache + whole-conversation mode (PR #120, closes #119).** The vision proxy now caches the text description produced per image (SHA-256 of its base64 bytes, 200-entry FIFO cache), so images already described in earlier turns are reused without calling the vision model again — saving Copilot quota and latency in multi-turn conversations where text-only models receive the same attachments every turn. `proxyVision()` now describes only the message that contains a _new_ image and resolves the vision model lazily (when all images are cached, no `selectChatModels()`/`sendRequest()` runs). A new opt-in setting `opencodego.visionProxyWholeConversation` (default `false`) restores whole-conversation context: when on, one request is sent over all messages so descriptions keep full context at the cost of more tokens (cache applies in both modes). Documented in `docs/issues/56-20260811-pr120-vision-proxy-description-cache.md`. PR [#120](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/120) by [@ChauThan](https://github.com/ChauThan).
- **`[VS Code]` Remove OpenCode Go / OpenCode Zen from Language Models.** Providers can now be removed from the Language Models list and every model picker like in GitHub Copilot's Manage Language Models: new `opencodego.enabled` / `opencodezen.enabled` settings (with matching `when` clauses on the vendor contributions) skip provider registration, plus `OpenCode Go/Zen: Remove/Re-add Provider in Language Models` commands and a **Remove from Language Models** action in the Manage Provider QuickPick. API keys and BYOK group settings are kept so re-enabling restores the provider unchanged. A window reload is required after toggling.
- **`[Agents]` OpenCode Go/Zen in the VS Code Agents window (#122).** VS Code ≥1.129 runs the Agents window in a separate agent host process and keeps the two mechanisms this feature depends on off by default: the experimental BYOK model bridge (`chat.agentHost.byokModels.enabled`) that mirrors extension BYOK models into agent-host sessions, and `extensions.supportAgentsWindow`, without which code extensions are disabled in the Agents window process entirely — so OpenCode Go/Zen were missing from both the Agents window model picker and its "+ Add Models" vendor list. The extension now auto-enables both settings on activation (gated by the new `opencodego.autoEnableAgentsWindow` setting, default `true`, merging with any existing user values), records what it flipped, and offers a reload button the first time. When the user disables `opencodego.agentsWindow` afterwards, only the settings the extension itself enabled are reverted. The legacy agent-host providers (`targetChatSessionType: "copilotcli"`) remain registered for VS Code 1.125–1.128, where the bridge does not exist. Documented in `docs/issues/58-20260811-pr125-agents-window-byok-bridge.md`. PR [#125](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/125) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).

### Fixed

- **`[Thinking]` Multi-turn reasoning echo for DeepSeek V4 (PR #123).** Follow-up turns on OpenAI-compatible reasoning models (DeepSeek V4 Flash and the rest of the DeepSeek family) failed with `HTTP 400: The reasoning_content in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API`, because `convertMessage()` dropped `LanguageModelThinkingPart` from assistant history. Thinking text from history is now extracted and echoed back as `reasoning_content` on assistant messages, gated by model family: DeepSeek (required), Gemini (maps to `thought: true` parts), GLM/Kimi/Qwen/MiniMax (tolerated); omitted for MiMo (issue #38), GPT (Responses API), Claude (Anthropic API), and unknown models. Documented in `docs/issues/55-20260811-pr123-deepseek-reasoning-content-echo.md`. PR [#123](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/123) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).
- **`[VS Code]` Provider context menu unresponsive; "+ Add Models" dead; leftover groups undeletable (#121).** The `languageModelChatProviders` contributions declared both `managementCommand` and a `configuration` schema. VS Code's native BYOK flow (`configureLanguageModelsProviderGroup`) short-circuits on `managementCommand` — it re-resolves models and returns without prompting for a group name or API key — so a BYOK group could never be created through "+ Add Models", and every built-in context-menu action (Rename Group, Update API Key, Delete, Open in Language Models (JSON)) throws "group not found", failing silently. Dropped `managementCommand` from the `opencodego`, `opencodezen`, and agent-variant contributions; "+ Add Models" now runs the native prompt flow, the context-menu actions work against the created group, and leftover groups (e.g. created by per-model configuration) can finally be deleted. The extension's own commands (`OpenCode Go: Manage Provider`, `Set API Key`, etc.) remain available in the Command Palette and keep working as a legacy fallback.

### Changed

- **`[Testing]` Reasoning history helpers extracted + unit-tested (PR #126, follow-up on #123).** The pure reasoning-history logic added by #123 (`shouldEchoThinkingHistory()` family gating and the `LanguageModelThinkingPart.value` normalization) was inlined in `src/extension.ts` with no unit tests. Extracted into a new pure module `src/reasoningHistory.ts` (`thinkingTextFromValue()` + `shouldEchoThinkingHistory()`) so the family gating is regression-covered without a VS Code host, with a +16-test suite (`src/test/reasoningHistory.test.ts`) covering every model family including the issue #38 MiMo carve-out. Also added the `typeof vscode.LanguageModelThinkingPart === "function"` runtime guard to `thinkingPartText()`, mirroring the defensive pattern already used in `src/streaming.ts` and the contract in `src/vscode.proposed.languageModelThinkingPart.d.ts`. No behavior change. Documented in `docs/issues/59-20260811-pr126-reasoning-history-guard-tests.md`. PR [#126](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/126) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-08-08

### Added

- **`[Streaming]` Transient 5xx gateway retry (#107).** The streaming request path now retries momentary gateway failures instead of failing on the first attempt: classic `502`/`503`/`504`, plus any `5xx` whose body names the OpenCode `Router.Unavailable` condition (no healthy backend for the model right now). The new pure classifier `isTransientServerError(status, errorDetail)` is conservative by design — unknown `5xx` payloads stay permanent so real bugs surface. Up to 2 retries with exponential backoff plus jitter (`TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_BASE_MS` 1s doubling, `TRANSIENT_5XX_RETRY_JITTER_MS` ≤250ms) to avoid piling concurrent retries onto the gateway at the same timestamp. Cancellation aborts the backoff immediately via the cancellation-aware `sleepWithCancellation`. `Router.Unavailable` errors now surface an actionable hint ("no healthy backend for this model right now — retry in a few seconds or switch models") instead of raw gateway JSON. Documented in `docs/issues/51-20260807-pr107-transient-5xx-retry-merge.md`. PR [#107](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/107) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).
- **`[VS Code]` Current BYOK metadata and model management.** OpenCode models are now explicitly marked with `isBYOK`, expose capacity warnings through the model picker warning field, and connect provider management buttons to the existing Manage commands.
- **`[Diagnostics]` Runtime and elevation details (#89).** Provider diagnostics now include the extension and VS Code versions, extension host, remote/UI mode, workspace trust, Node/platform details, Windows integrity level, installation paths, credential presence, and model-selection errors. Added `OpenCode: Configure Utility Models` and linked diagnostics/utility settings from the provider Manage menu.

### Fixed

- **`[Responses]` Long sessions rejected with `invalid_prompt` (#103).** Responses requests now send `truncation: "auto"`, omit the proxy-sensitive `text.verbosity` field, and cap `max_output_tokens` to the context remaining after the normalized prompt. Prompt estimation now happens after vision proxying and old-image trimming. The limit and request-envelope logic were extracted into pure modules with regression tests.
- **`[Vision]` Image attachments on Responses-routed models rejected with `invalid_prompt` (HTTP 400).** `gpt-5.6-luna` (and every GPT-5.x model on OpenCode Go) failed on the first turn with an image attached: the Responses input serializer emitted `input_image.image_url` as the Chat Completions nested object `{ url: "…" }`, but the Responses API expects a plain string (URL or base64 data URL) and rejects the nested shape. The serializer now emits `image_url` as a string. The Responses input conversion was extracted from `src/extension.ts` into the pure, unit-tested `src/responsesRequest.ts` (`responsesInputItemsFromMessage` + `joinedTextContent`), with a regression suite covering the string shape, empty messages, assistant tool calls, and image-bearing tool results. Documented in `docs/issues/49-20260808-luna-image-invalid-prompt.md`.
- **`[Context]` DeepSeek V4 Flash overflow with large tool-enabled sessions (#109).** Request-time prompt estimates now include VS Code/Copilot tool schemas instead of counting only messages, and reserve proportional tokenizer headroom rather than a fixed 64-token margin. If an upstream tokenizer still reports an exact context overflow, the HTTP 400 recovery path uses the provider's authoritative context/request/completion counts to reduce the Chat, Messages, Responses, or Gemini output budget and retry once. The protection applies to every transport and model family.
- **`[Credentials]` Cached models lost their API key after an Extension Host restart.** Response handling now falls back to the extension's SecretStorage when VS Code invokes a cached selected model before model discovery has rebuilt the in-memory model-to-key map.
- **`[VS Code]` Manage Models rejected the extension for using the `chatProvider` proposal.** Model metadata no longer advertises the proposal-gated `capabilities.editTools` field, so the published extension works in regular VS Code without `--enable-proposed-api`.
- **`[Reliability]` Cancellation listener leaks.** Model discovery and streaming retry delays now dispose VS Code cancellation subscriptions after success, timeout, or cancellation. The provider connection test also has a 30-second timeout.
- **`[Usage]` Profile label missing from the SVG tooltip.** The active profile label is now forwarded to the SVG builder instead of being calculated and discarded.
- **`[Build]` Removed source files no longer survive in the VSIX.** Compilation now cleans `out/` before invoking TypeScript, preventing stale artifacts such as the removed autocomplete implementation from being packaged.

### Changed

- **`[VS Code]` Utility-model configuration is user-controlled.** Activation no longer silently modifies the global `chat.byokUtilityModelDefault` setting. The new command opens the three official utility-model settings instead.
- **`[CI]` Tests, JavaScript lint, and VSIX packaging are blocking checks.** CI no longer reports success when tests or packaging fail, and the existing TypeScript/JavaScript lint baseline is clean.
- **`[Package]` Development-only files are excluded from the VSIX.** Internal docs, scripts, compiled tests, source maps, GitHub/Husky configuration, and lint configuration are no longer shipped; the README demo and Photon runtime remain included.

- **`[Provider]` OpenCode Zen models listed twice when using a native BYOK group (#106).** With the API key configured via VS Code's Manage Models / BYOK flow, every OpenCode Zen model appeared twice (16 instead of 8). VS Code calls `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` once without a group and then once per configured group, namespacing identifiers by group — so the secrets-backed set emitted on the groupless call (since 0.5.0, #86) was kept alongside the group's set. The provider now records per vendor when a BYOK group has been configured and the groupless call stays silent in that case; the `Clear API Key` action resets the flag. Documented in `docs/issues/48-20260805-issue106-zen-duplicate-models.md`.
- **`[Tooling]` Prettier codemod and markdownlint cleanup (#114).** One-shot formatting pass across 99 files (docs, `src`, scripts, config) so the #110 pre-commit hook stops being a tripwire and `git blame`/`git bisect` stay clean. `npm run format` applied using the existing `.prettierrc.json` (formatting only, no logic changes), and markdownlint went from 2219 to 0 issues: `.markdownlint.json` relaxes MD033/MD041/MD060 and scopes MD024 to `siblings_only`, 51 bare code fences gained `text`/`md` language tags, literal `|` pipes inside inline code were escaped (a real table rendering bug), a duplicate `### Changed` in this file was merged, and a README heading level was fixed. Documented in `docs/issues/54-20260808-pr114-format-codemod-merge.md`. PR [#114](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/114) by [@Fahad090NP](https://github.com/Fahad090NP).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-05

### Added

- **`[Model Picker]` Optional provider prefixes (#92).** Added `opencodego.showProviderPrefix` (default `true`) to hide `OpenCode Go` / `OpenCode Zen` prefixes in narrow model pickers when desired. Changes refresh the registered model names immediately. Documented in `docs/issues/45-20260803-issue92-provider-prefix.md`.
- **`[Model Picker]` Kimi context-size selector (#87).** Kimi models with a context window larger than 256K now expose `256K` and the full window in the per-model configuration schema, with the smaller tier selected by default. Documented in `docs/issues/46-20260803-issue87-kimi-context-size.md`.

### Fixed

- **`[Vision]` Normalize image attachments before OpenCode Go requests (#94).** Image data URLs are resized and re-encoded using the same 2000x2000 / 5 MB base64 limits used by OpenCode's CLI, while preserving the original image when normalization is unavailable. Documented in `docs/issues/44-20260803-issue94-image-normalization.md`.

### Changed

- **`[Vision]` Top-level image handling superseded by normalizer (#94).** The previous `MAX_TOP_LEVEL_IMAGE_BYTES = 2_000_000` raw-byte guard that replaced oversized top-level attachments with a placeholder text part has been **removed**. Top-level images now flow through the new image normalizer (`src/imageNormalizer.ts`, powered by `@silvia-odwyer/photon-node`) **before** a final `MAX_IMAGE_BASE64_BYTES = 5 MB` base64 payload guard, so images that were previously dropped can now be resized and sent successfully. `convertMessage()` is now `async`. The separate `MAX_TOOL_RESULT_IMAGE_BYTES = 1_000_000` (1 MB raw) guard for MCP tool-result images is retained, since the normalizer does not bound the cumulative multi-image accumulation case. The superseded `docs/issues/38-20260725-top-level-image-size-guard.md` is marked deprecated.

## [0.4.5] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **`[Provider]` Non-agent OpenCode Zen returns 0 models when API key set via the extension command (#86).** When the Zen API key was stored via `OpenCode Go: Set API Key` instead of VS Code's native Manage Models / BYOK flow, `vscode.lm.selectChatModels({ vendor: "opencodezen" })` returned 0 models, so Zen free models never appeared in the Chat model picker. Root cause: the `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` fallback guard `if (!apiKey && (this.definition.isAgentVariant || options.configuration))` skipped the SecretStorage fallback for non-agent providers when `options.configuration` was `undefined` — which is exactly what VS Code passes when the user never configured a native BYOK group. The previous in-code comment claiming this was a "still resolving" state was incorrect; verified against `microsoft/vscode` `vscode.proposed.chatProvider.d.ts` and the reference implementation in Copilot's `AbstractLanguageModelChatProvider`. The guard is now simply `if (!apiKey)`, mirroring Copilot's own pattern. This also fixes the identical latent bug on non-agent `opencodego`. Closes #86. Documented in `docs/issues/43-20260803-issue86-zen-nonagent-0-models.md`.

- **`[Streaming]` Premature tool-call flush caused empty `<invoke>` calls and an unrecoverable tool-calling loop (#98).** The 0.4.4 fix for gpt-5.6-luna (#93) flushed accumulated tool calls whenever `finish_reason` was `null`/`undefined` and tool calls were pending. Standard OpenAI-compatible streams (DeepSeek-V4 via OpenCode Zen, plus Kimi, GLM, Qwen non-plus, MiniMax non-m2.x, MiMo) report `finish_reason: null` on EVERY intermediate chunk, so the first tool-call delta chunk flushed an INCOMPLETE call — empty arguments parsed as `{}`, and VS Code rendered `<invoke>` without `<parameter>`. The model then looped retrying the malformed call. `OpenAiResponseExtractor` now flushes ONLY on `finish_reason === "tool_calls"`; gateways that omit it (gpt-5.6-luna on OpenCode Go) are flushed once at end-of-stream via the new `flushRemainingToolCalls()`, so #93 stays fixed. Tool-call accumulation was extracted into a pure, unit-tested `ToolCallAccumulator` (`src/toolCallAccumulator.ts`, no `vscode` import). Documented in `docs/issues/42-20260803-premature-tool-call-flush.md`.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **`[Routing]` GPT 5.6 Luna on OpenCode Go — routing, tool calling, and reasoning (#93).** OpenCode Go docs require `gpt-5.6-luna` on the Responses API endpoint (`/v1/responses`), not chat-completions. Three issues were fixed: (1) Routing — GPT models were sent to `chat-completions` which doesn't support reasoning or tool calling for this model; now routed to Responses API per OpenCode Go docs. (2) Tool calls — the gateway sends tool calls in standard OpenAI format but omits `finish_reason` on the final chunk (`null` instead of `"tool_calls"`); `OpenAiResponseExtractor` now flushes pending tool calls when `finish_reason` is `null`/`undefined` and there are accumulated calls. (3) Reasoning — `buildResponsesRequestBody()` did not include `thinkingPayload`; added reasoning payload in Responses API format (`{ reasoning: { effort } }`). Added `openai` thinking family with effort levels (off/low/medium/high/xhigh). Diagnostic logging auto-activates when gateway reports completion tokens but extractor finds nothing. Documented in `docs/issues/41-20260803-gpt56-luna-routing-fix.md`.

- **`[Usage]` Usage monitor SVG card too narrow — values unreadable (#85).** The usage monitor SVG card (shown in status bar tooltip and webview panel) was 330px wide (345px with session data), causing the bottom statistics section to cram 6 values per line with gaps as small as 33px — making costs, request counts, and token counts hard to read. Widened the card to 420px (440px with session) and adjusted all column positions proportionally: progress bar width 256→340px, column spacing minimum 33→40px with most gaps at 80px. Tooltip image width updated to 420px, webview max-width to 560px. Documented in `docs/issues/25-20260803-usage-monitor-ui-width-fix.md`.

- **`[Vision]` Trim old images from conversation history — fix `400 Upstream request failed` on MiMo + MCP screenshot loops (#38 follow-up).** Even with per-image size guards (`MAX_TOOL_RESULT_IMAGE_BYTES` 1 MB, `MAX_TOP_LEVEL_IMAGE_BYTES` 2 MB), MCP-driven agentic workflows (`chrome-devtools-mcp`, `playwright-mcp`) accumulated multiple screenshots in conversation history and hit the OpenCode Go gateway's upstream limit. Documented in `docs/issues/34-20260720-mcp-tool-result-image-dropped.md` line 264+: a `mimo-v2.5` agent loop reached `payloadBytes=4665383` (4.6 MB) after 8 screenshots and started failing every subsequent request with HTTP 400. VS Code Copilot Chat is _supposed_ to trim history based on `advertisedMaxInputTokens`, but our local estimator under-counts base64 image data (`IMAGE_TOKEN_ESTIMATE = 1024` per image vs. realistic ~80K tokens/MB), so VS Code never sees the true payload weight. New function `trimOldImagesFromHistoryInPlace()` keeps only the most recent `MAX_HISTORY_IMAGES_KEPT = 2` images and replaces older ones with a short placeholder text note ("Earlier screenshot omitted from history..."). The model retains conversation structure and the latest screenshots for immediate agentic context (compare current vs. previous), while cumulative payload stays bounded. OpenAI and Anthropic vision models auto-resize each image to a 1568–2576 px patch budget upstream, so old screenshots lose most of their pixel value once a newer one arrives — the model rarely benefits from keeping more than 2 in flight. Applied after vision proxy (so proxy text descriptions are preserved) and before `promptTokens` estimation (so the output budget reflects the trimmed payload). Diagnostic log line `[history-trim] Replaced N old image(s)...` appears in the Output channel when trimming fires.

- **`[Vision]` Top-level image attachment size guard — prevent `400 Upstream request failed` on oversized pasted images (#38).** Pasting or dragging a large image (4K screenshot, high-res phone photo) into Copilot Chat with a vision-capable OpenCode model (e.g. `mimo-v2.5`) produced a multi-MB base64 payload that the OpenCode Go gateway rejected with HTTP 400. The top-level image handler in `convertMessage()` had **no size guard**, unlike MCP tool-result images which were already capped at 1 MB by `MAX_TOOL_RESULT_IMAGE_BYTES` (PR #79). New constant `MAX_TOP_LEVEL_IMAGE_BYTES = 2_000_000` (2 MB raw, intentionally more liberal than the 1 MB tool-result cap because user screenshots/photos are typically larger than pre-compressed MCP screenshots). Images exceeding the limit are replaced with an actionable placeholder text part — the model still knows an image was attached, and the user gets the actual byte count, the limit, and a hint to resize/compress. Threshold rationale (evidence-based): Anthropic publishes a 5–10 MB per-image limit, OpenCode Go was verified to reject 3.18 MB, and upstream vision models auto-resize to a 1568–2576 px patch budget anyway — so there is no fidelity benefit to forwarding multi-MB raw images. See `docs/issues/38-20260725-top-level-image-size-guard.md`.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **`[Streaming]` `estimateTokenCount` overestimation caused `max_tokens: 1` on large conversations (#83).** The word-count-based heuristic (`words * 1.15`) in `estimateTokenCount()` dramatically overestimates token counts for JSON-serialized chat messages (3-5× actual), because every structural character (`{`, `}`, `"`, `:`, `,`) is counted as a separate "word". For conversations approaching the context window limit (~754K tokens), this inflated `safeOutputBudget` to 1, sending `max_tokens: 1` to the API — models generated exactly 1 token then stopped with `finishReason: length`. Replaced with a charEstimate-based heuristic using OpenAI's standard "1 token ≈ 4 characters" rule, plus a 10% buffer for code-heavy text and CJK character accounting. Added `MIN_OUTPUT_BUDGET = 4096` as a safety net to prevent budget collapse under any estimation scenario.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`[Thinking]` `budget_tokens` cap for MiMo thinking payload (#36).** MiMo 2.5 / 2.5-Pro reasoning can loop indefinitely when `reasoning_effort` is set without a token budget. Each effort level now sends `budget_tokens`: `low` → 8,192, `medium` → 16,384, `high` → 32,768. Graceful degradation via `retry.ts` handler for HTTP 400 `"budget_tokens"` rejection.
- **`[Streaming]` Go gateway `reasoning_content` workaround (#36, #37635).** The opencode-go gateway places ALL streaming response text inside `reasoning_content` instead of `content` (upstream bug [#37635](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/37635)). When a Go-gateway request has NO `reasoning_effort` in the body (MiMo thinking OFF), `reasoning_content` is emitted as visible text instead of a thinking part. When `reasoning_effort` IS present (thinking ON), CoT correctly stays in the thinking panel. Zen gateway and all other providers unaffected. Can be removed once upstream #37635 is fixed.
- **`[Streaming]` Suffix-repetition loop detection (#36).** `OpenAiResponseExtractor.handleReasoning()` now tracks 40-char suffix across consecutive reasoning chunks. If the same suffix repeats 6+ times, the model is stuck in a word-level loop — thinking parts are suppressed and a visible warning `[Reasoning loop detected — thinking output suppressed]` is emitted instead.
- **`[Commands]` Top-level `Refresh Models` commands for Go and Zen (#78).** The `Refresh Models` action was previously buried inside the `OpenCode Go: Manage Provider` QuickPick, and Zen had no manual refresh path at all. Two new commands are now registered: `OpenCode Go: Refresh Models` and `OpenCode Zen: Refresh Models`, each bypassing the Manage menu and going straight to a model-list fetch. For parity, `OpenCode Zen: Manage Provider` is also added, matching the existing Go command. The new commands are especially useful when the picker is showing a stale or bundled list at startup (issue #78) and you want to force a re-fetch without opening the Manage menu.
- **`[Vision]` Multimodal tool results — MCP screenshot forwarding (#77).** Images returned inside a `LanguageModelToolResultPart` (e.g. screenshots from `chrome-devtools-mcp`, `playwright-mcp`) are now forwarded to vision-capable models. Previously these images were silently dropped by the serialization layer and the model would report "I cannot see the image". Images are encoded as OpenAI-style `image_url` content parts and translated into the native multimodal shape for each transport: chat-completions (native array content), Anthropic messages (`tool_result.content: AnthropicContentBlock[]`), Google Gemini (`functionResponse.response.parts: [{inlineData}]`). Oversized images (>1 MB raw bytes) are replaced with an actionable placeholder note so a single full-page MCP screenshot can't push the request payload past the upstream limit. The Responses API cannot carry images in tool output and degrades to a placeholder note on that transport only.

### Fixed

- **`[Streaming]` Regressive visible-text suppression removed.** Previous guards (`contentAfterReasoning`, `shouldSuppressTextEmit`) incorrectly blocked visible text emission for ALL reasoning models. These models naturally produce `reasoning_content` first then `content` — this is normal, not degradation. Both guards removed; only suffix-repetition loop detection remains active.
- **`[Streaming]` Go gateway reasoning leak fix (#36, #37635).** MiMo 2.5 responses were leaking thinking content into the visible chat when thinking was OFF. The `treatReasoningAsContent` workaround now only activates when ALL conditions are met: (1) request URL includes `/zen/go/`, (2) `reasoning_effort` is NOT in the request body, (3) `delta.content` is empty. This ensures the workaround applies only to the MiMo-thinking-OFF scenario while leaving all other models untouched.
- **`[Logging]` Model registration log spam during UI refresh.** VS Code refreshes model info on roughly a 300 ms cadence during chat UI activity; each call previously produced one log line per registered model (22+ lines per call). `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` now emits a single summary line per invocation (`Models registered: count=N provider=… first=… last=…`). Output channel is dramatically cleaner during testing.
- **`[Logging]` Transient model-list fetch failures no longer pop a modal warning.** OpenCode's shared gateway occasionally returns transient 400/503 responses that resolve on retry within seconds, and the previous behavior called `showWarningMessage` on every failure — including from auto-registered provider variants the user may not actively use (e.g. `OpenCode Zen (Agents)`). Failures now log to the Output channel only; the bundled `fallbackModels` snapshot keeps the picker functional.
- **`[Resilience]` Model-list fetch now tolerates transient network failures (#78).** On flaky networks (and especially on VS Code 1.129 where the new agent host raises the rate of concurrent `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` calls), a single `TypeError: fetch failed` at startup — DNS wobble, TCP reset, undici socket reuse race ([`nodejs/undici#5450`](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/5450)) — caused the picker to drop to the bundled list or empty out entirely ("flash then disappear"). `fetchModels()` now (1) wraps each attempt in `AbortSignal.timeout(15_000)` so a hung connect can't stall the picker for the full undici default of 5 minutes, (2) retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (500 ms / 1 s / 2 s) on transient errors only — `ECONNRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, HTTP 408/429/5xx, and the generic `TypeError: fetch failed` wrapper — never on `AbortError` from VS Code's `CancellationToken` or on HTTP 4xx, (3) sends a `User-Agent` header built from the extension's `packageJSON.version` so strict gateways don't silently drop the request and so the version string can't drift again, (4) caches every successful fetch to `globalState` (`opencode.modelListCache.v1::<vendor>`, TTL 1 hour) and prefers that snapshot over the bundled list when all retries fail, (5) composes the caller's `CancellationToken` with the timeout via `AbortSignal.any([...])` so a cancelled resolution tears down the in-flight fetch immediately, and (6) sends an explicit `Accept: application/json` header so SSL-inspecting corporate firewalls / VPN proxies (Zscaler, Netskope, Fortinet) don't drop the GET as an anonymous scanner — the #78 reporter sits behind a VPN + corporate firewall on Windows 11, where POST `/chat/completions` with a JSON content type was passing but the bare GET `/models` was being dropped. See `docs/issues/35-20260720-issue78-model-list-fetch-resilience.md`.

- **`[Logging]` Model registration log spam during UI refresh.** VS Code refreshes model info on roughly a 300 ms cadence during chat UI activity; each call previously produced one log line per registered model (22+ lines per call). `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` now emits a single summary line per invocation (`Models registered: count=N provider=… first=… last=…`). Output channel is dramatically cleaner during testing.
- **`[Logging]` Transient model-list fetch failures no longer pop a modal warning.** OpenCode's shared gateway occasionally returns transient 400/503 responses that resolve on retry within seconds, and the previous behavior called `showWarningMessage` on every failure — including from auto-registered provider variants the user may not actively use (e.g. `OpenCode Zen (Agents)`).

See `docs/issues/35-20260720-issue78-model-list-fetch-resilience.md`.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- **`[Vision]` Transparent vision proxy for text-only models (#74).** Run **OpenCode Go: Configure Vision Proxy** from the Command Palette to pick a vision-capable model. When a non-vision OpenCode model receives an image, the extension forwards it to the configured model, receives a text description, and feeds that to the original model — so text-only models "see" images with zero extra steps. The picker shows only vision-capable models (filtered by `models.dev` metadata), with a **None** option to disable and a **Customize prompt** entry to edit the description instruction. No settings to toggle — if a model is configured, the proxy is on. Implemented with `vscode.lm.selectChatModels` + `sendRequest`. PR [#76](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/76) by [@Wallacy](https://github.com/Wallacy).

### Fixed

- **`[Streaming]` Context overflow 400 when prompt + output approached the model's limit (#68).** `estimateTokenCount` can underestimate by 0–2%, pushing payloads past the context window on large prompts. Added a 64-token safety margin (`TOKEN_ESTIMATE_SAFETY_MARGIN`) to `promptReserve` in `modelLimits()`. Affects all models (reported with GLM-5.2).
- **`[Streaming]` Empty response warning no longer steals focus to the Output pane (#67).** Removed the stray `.show(true)` call on the empty-response diagnostic log.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-13

### Added

- **`[Usage]` Per-profile Go usage tracking for multi-account setups.** Users with multiple OpenCode Go subscriptions (e.g. work + personal) can now add separate Go entries in the Manage Language Models panel. The extension auto-creates a named profile ("Profile 1", "Profile 2", etc.) on the first request with each key. Storage is namespaced per profile so usage data never mixes. Fixes [#63](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/63). PR [#75](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/75) by [@Wallacy](https://github.com/Wallacy).
- **`[Usage]` Profile auto-switch and QuickPick.** The active profile follows the last used model. Click the status bar to open a QuickPick listing all profiles; the active one is checked, others are clickable switches. The SVG hover card and status bar show the active profile label (e.g. `Go: 5%·12%·8% [Profile 2]`).
- **`[Usage]` Profile management commands.** `OpenCode Go: Rename Active Profile` and `OpenCode Go: Delete Profile` let users manage their profiles. Delete includes a confirmation dialog and cleans up all namespaced storage.
- **`[Usage]` Legacy data migration.** Users upgrading from a single-account install get their existing usage data migrated into Profile 1 automatically on first multi-profile activation. Nothing is lost.

### Fixed

- **`[Usage]` 5-hour rolling usage now isolates per profile in multi-profile mode.** The shared `opencode.db` SQLite database has no API key column, so reading it in multi-account mode mixed quota from all accounts. The tracker now skips SQLite entirely when multiple profiles exist and falls back to extension-tracked entries (which are namespaced per profile). This trades billed-accuracy for correct per-profile isolation.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-07-09

### Added

- **`[Thinking]` Reasoning now surfaced to Copilot Chat as collapsible thinking blocks.** Previously, reasoning content from OpenCode models (DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, MiniMax, MiMo) was accumulated internally but never emitted to the VS Code Chat UI as a thinking part — so `chat.agent.thinkingStyle` (`collapsed` / `collapsedPreview` / `fixedScrolling`) had no effect, and reasoning either appeared as flat plain text or was silently dropped. The extension now streams reasoning per-chunk via the proposed `LanguageModelThinkingPart` API (available at runtime since VS Code ~1.102, well within our `^1.125.0` floor), across all four transports (chat-completions, Anthropic messages, OpenAI responses, Google Gemini) and both streaming + non-stream response paths. This makes `chat.agent.thinkingStyle` work for OpenCode BYOK models, matching the behavior of Copilot-hosted models. Falls back to the legacy accumulate-and-flush behavior on hypothetical older hosts via a runtime guard. Tool-call replication (`onReasoningContent`) and think-tag filtering (`opencodego.stripThinkTags`) remain intact and compose with the new surfacing. No `enabledApiProposals` declaration needed. Verified working with DeepSeek and Kimi in Copilot Chat. Fixes [#22](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/22) and [#71](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/71). See `docs/issues/33-20260709-thinking-part-byok-surfacing-research.md`.

### Changed

- **`[Streaming]` `[stream-summary]` log now reports total reasoning characters accurately.** Previously, `reasoningChars` in the log reflected only the remaining `reasoningContent` string, which is cleared by `flushToolCalls` (for tool-call replication) and `flushReasoningFallback` — so the metric showed `0` even when reasoning was streamed. Now tracks a monotonic `totalReasoningChars` counter that survives clears, giving accurate per-response reasoning metrics for debugging.

### Fixed

- **`[Usage]` Monthly cost aggregation now respects the subscription anchor.** The monthly window was using calendar month after a regression, but OpenCode Go billing is anchor-based (subscription day/hour). The tracker now derives the window from three tiers: (1) user-configured anchor via "Set spent targets", (2) auto-anchor from the earliest SQLite row (matching actual billing start), (3) calendar month fallback. Also fixes `setManualSpentTargets` which previously computed the monthly cost for the old window before storing the anchor, causing tracked+baseline to mismatch the target. Now reads SQLite costs directly using the prospective window (with the new anchor).

## [0.3.6] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **`[Compatibility]` Auto-fix VS Code 1.128 BYOK utility model error.** VS Code 1.128 changed the default of `chat.byokUtilityModelDefault` to `"none"`, silently breaking all background utility tasks (chat title generation, commit messages, intent detection) for BYOK users. On activation, the extension now checks whether any utility model setting is already configured; if not, it automatically writes `chat.byokUtilityModelDefault = "mainAgent"` to global settings and shows a one-time toast. The fix runs only on VS Code ≥1.128 and never overwrites a value the user has already set. See `docs/issues/32-20260708-vscode-128-byok-utility-model.md`.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`[Usage]` Session-level cost tracking.** The status bar tooltip, SVG hover card, and usage QuickPick now show the cost of the current chat session (requests, tokens, USD). Each chat thread gets a unique `sessionId` derived from conversation content; the tracker accumulates costs per session in memory. Sessions idle for >2h are pruned automatically, capped at 50 active sessions, and persisted across restarts.
- **`[Usage]` VS Code session cost fields (`copilotCredits`).** Added `copilotCredits` to `UsageSnapshot`, `ProviderUsagePayload`, `TransportRequestSummary`, and `UsageLogEntry`. The `onTransportSummary` callback now computes credits (`cost × 100`, since 1 credit = $0.01) and mutates the summary directly so the `LanguageModelDataPart("usage")` emitted at the end of each response includes the credit total. This is the standard mechanism VS Code uses to accumulate per-session cost in `IChatModel.sessionCost`.
- **`[Usage]` SQLite-backed subscription cost accuracy.** The `getSummary()` method now reads the OpenCode CLI database (`opencode.db`) as its primary cost source. The database contains actual billed amounts, replacing the local estimate that drifted 9–15% (issue [#23](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/23)). When the CLI database is available, subscription totals (session 5h, weekly, monthly, today, yesterday) reflect real billing data. Token and request counts are still enriched from tracked entries (SQLite stores cost only). Falls back to the local estimate when the CLI database is absent. Fixes [#59](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/59).

### Changed

- **`[Model Picker]` Removed `triggerChange()` cross-provider re-resolution.** The agent-variant providers now resolve their API key independently via the secrets fallback path (`isAgentVariant || options.configuration`). Previously, the base provider called `triggerChange()` on the agent provider to force it to re-resolve after storing the BYOK key — this indirection is no longer needed since both paths reach the same `SecretStorage` read.
- **`[Model Picker]` Removed `categoryOrder` from `ProviderDefinition`.** This field was left over from the old `category: { label, order }` object that crashed the picker on VS Code ≥1.126 (fixed in 0.3.4). It was never read after the type was changed to a plain string.
- **`[Deps]` Bumped `@types/node` 25.9.3 → 26.1.0, `@vscode/vsce` 3.9.1 → 3.9.2, `@types/vscode` 1.120.0 → 1.125.0.** Minimum VS Code engine bumped from 1.120.0 to 1.125.0 to match `@types/vscode`.

### Fixed

- **`[Thinking]` GLM thinking enum values corrected, output popup removed, API key passed on model fetch.** [#61](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/61): Removed invalid `'on'` from GLM thinking enum — GLM models now accept only `'off'`/`'high'`/`'max'`. `reasoning_effort` is sent for GLM when the value is effort-based (`high`/`max`). Combined GLM/Kimi thinking schema split into separate blocks for clarity. [#67](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/67): Removed `getOutputChannel().show(true)` calls that caused random output popups during model fetch. [#62](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/62): `Authorization` header is now passed when fetching the model list (previously missing). Added comprehensive unit tests for GLM effort values. PR [#68](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/68) by [@Wallacy](https://github.com/Wallacy).
- **`[Request]` DeepSeek 400 error when prompt + completion exceeds context window.** When the prompt is large (e.g. 668K tokens on deepseek-v4-flash), the requested `max_tokens` (384K) combined with the prompt exceeded the 1048K context window, causing a 400 error from the provider. `modelLimits()` now caps `maxOutputTokens` to `contextWindow - promptReserve` using the estimated prompt size, preventing context overflow across all providers and endpoint types.
- **`[Security]` Picker debug log no longer leaks API keys.** The previous `JSON.stringify(options)` debug log wrote the full `options` object (including `configuration.apiKey`) to the Output channel in plaintext. Removed entirely — the log served only as a temporary diagnostic during the 1.125/1.126 picker investigation and is no longer needed.
- **`[Security]` `Clear API Key` action now warns about BYOK re-persistence.** When the user clears the key via `SecretStorage`, the next picker resolution re-stores it from `options.configuration` (BYOK). The info message now tells the user to also remove it from the Manage Models panel if they want a full clear.
- **`[Performance]` `reasoningContentByToolCallId` capped at 500 entries.** In long agent sessions (many tool calls), this `Map` grew without limit — one entry per `toolCallId` was added but never evicted. Over a multi-hour session this could accumulate thousands of entries of reasoning text. Now uses a LRU-style eviction: when the map exceeds 500 entries, the oldest entries (by insertion order) are removed. At ~200–500 tokens per reasoning chunk, 500 entries ≈ 100K–250K tokens of cached reasoning, which comfortably covers the most intensive agent workflows while bounding memory growth.
- **`[Performance]` `[sse-stats]` log now gated behind `debugReasoning`.** The SSE stats line was logged unconditionally on every streamed response, adding noise to the Output channel. Now gated behind the existing `debugReasoning` setting, matching the other SSE-level logs.
- **`[Optimization]` Removed dead `agentProvidersByBaseVendor` map.** This `Map<string, OpenCodeProvider>` was populated during activation but never read after `triggerChange()` was removed. It held strong references to the agent provider instances unnecessarily.

### Known Issues

- **`[Usage]` Session cost does not appear in the VS Code session info popover (the "ring" below the chat input).** VS Code 1.126 accumulates session cost by reading `usage.copilotCredits` from `IChatUsage` progress events (`{ kind: 'usage', copilotCredits: ... }`). This works for the Copilot provider because the Copilot extension's `ToolCallingLoop` explicitly calls `stream.usage({ copilotCredits })` after each model fetch. For BYOK providers (like OpenCode), the extension reports a `LanguageModelDataPart` with MIME `"usage"` at the end of the response stream — the same pattern used by Copilot's own BYOK providers (`AnthropicLMProvider`, `GeminiNativeProvider`). However, VS Code 1.126 does not convert `{ type: 'data', mimeType: 'usage' }` from BYOK provider streams into `IChatUsage` progress events. This is a VS Code limitation, not a missing extension feature. The data is correctly structured and available; the VS Code ChatService (`acceptResponseProgress`) simply does not process BYOK usage data parts yet. We expect this to be addressed in a future VS Code release. In the meantime, session cost is visible in the extension's own status bar tooltip and usage QuickPick.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`[Usage]` Status bar click opens usage QuickPick.** Clicking the OpenCode Go usage status bar item now opens a QuickPick with session, weekly, and monthly progress bars, usage percentages, and reset countdowns. Quick actions: "Set spent targets…" and "Open full usage panel". Before this, the status bar was hover-only. No click handler.

### Fixed

- **`[Model Picker]` Chat model picker no longer crashes on VS Code ≥1.126.** The `category` field in `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` was typed as `{ label, order }`, but VS Code's `LanguageModelChatInformation.category` expects a plain `string`. The unified picker calls `category.charAt(0)`, which throws `TypeError` on an object. Now a plain string (`this.definition.displayName`). Fixes [#51](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/51).
- **`[Model Picker]` OpenCode models now appear on VS Code ≥1.126.** VS Code 1.126 sends `options.configuration={}` (empty object) instead of the BYOK key for non-agent providers. The extension now falls back to `SecretStorage` whenever `options.configuration` is present but holds no usable API key. This covers both agent variants (which never receive BYOK keys) and 1.126+ non-agent providers, with no version checks.
- **`[Usage]` Baseline editing recalculates correctly on re-edit.** `setManualSpentTargets()` now computes `baseline = target - tracked` for all three periods, without clamping to 0. Negative baselines are now allowed: they offset tracked entries downward, so `display = tracked + baseline = target`. Previously, `Math.max(0, ...)` blocked negative baselines. When a user lowered a target below the tracked amount, the display never updated because the delta clamped to 0. Session and weekly periods now also use delta-based calculation (matching monthly) instead of absolute target injection, which fixes expiry behavior.
- **`[Usage]` Input validation rejects non-numeric characters.** The usage target editor now validates input against the regex `/^-?\d+[.,]?\d*$/`. Strings like `60f` or `18asd` are rejected (previously `parseFloat` would silently accept the leading number). Both `.` and `,` work as decimal separators.
- **`[Usage]` Status bar tooltip refreshes immediately after editing targets.** `refreshGoUsageStatusBar()` now runs right after `setManualSpentTargets()`. The hover tooltip updates on the spot, no window reload needed.
- **`[Usage]` Removed dead `setCostResolver()` method.** `CostResolver` is injected via constructor closure and never updated after init. The setter was unreachable.
- **`[Usage]` Validation limits now derive from `GO_LIMITS`.** Input box validation for session ($12), weekly ($30), and monthly ($60) limits reads from the exported `GO_LIMITS` constant rather than hardcoded numbers. If limits change, the validation follows.
- **`[Usage]` Tooltip command link now uses `supportedCommands`.** Added `md.supportedCommands = ["opencodego.setUsageTargets"]` to the usage tooltip. The `[$(pencil) Set spent targets]` link now renders as a clickable command across VS Code versions.

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **`[Usage]` Manual usage targets editor for the Go usage tracker.** New command **"OpenCode Go: Set Usage Targets…"** (`opencodego.setUsageTargets`) opens 5 sequential input boxes pre-filled with current values — session spent (5h rolling, limit $12), weekly spent (Mon–Mon UTC, limit $30), monthly spent (limit $60), monthly reset day (1–31), and monthly reset hour (0–23 UTC). Press Enter to keep the current value; Escape cancels the flow. Targets persist in `globalState` as baseline amounts, with a custom `expiresAt` anchor for the monthly counter. The status bar tooltip now links to this command via a `[$(pencil) Set spent targets]` markdown command link. Closes [#23](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/23). PR [#50](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/50) by [@Wallacy](https://github.com/Wallacy).
- **`[Reliability]` Runtime retry for HTTP 400 parameter errors.** When the upstream API rejects a parameter (thinking, temperature, reasoning_effort), the extension now parses the error message, patches the request body, and retries once automatically. This handles stale models.dev metadata and provider API changes without requiring a code release. Handles: `thinking.type` rejection, `invalid temperature`, `enable_thinking` rejection, `reasoning_effort` format mismatch, and generic `Extra inputs are not permitted`. Implemented in `src/retry.ts` with 8 unit tests + 7 E2E tests (mock server). Body consumption bug fixed to prevent double-read on non-recoverable errors.
- **`[Tooling]` Model validation script (`scripts/validate-models.mts`).** Pre-release validation that tests ALL thinking/reasoning parameter combinations for each model against the live OpenCode API. Reuses the extension's exact logic (`buildThinkingPayload`, `resolveModelRouting`, `buildOpenCodeGatewayAuthHeaders`) — no duplicated routing/auth/thinking code. Fetches live model list from models.dev. Run: `npm run validate-models -- --api-key YOUR_KEY`. Validated 89 parameter combinations across 18 models (13 Go + 5 Zen free) — all passing.
- **`[Tooling]` E2E retry test (`scripts/test-retry-e2e.mts`).** Mock server simulates OpenCode API behavior. Proves retry flow: HTTP 400 → `analyzeHttp400ForRetry()` → patch → retry → HTTP 200. Covers 5 recovery scenarios + 2 no-retry scenarios. Run: `npm run test-retry` (no API key needed).
- **`[Tooling]` Pre-release validation hook.** `npm run prepackage` now runs compile + test before packaging.

### Changed

- **`[Usage]` Monthly reset display respects user-configured anchor date.** `buildSummaryFromRows` and `buildSummaryFromTracked` now return `baseline.monthly.expiresAt` as `resetsAt` when a monthly baseline exists, so the "resets in Xd Yh" text reflects the user-set anchor instead of the auto-calculated month end. Previously the manual anchor was ignored on display.
- **`[Usage]` Live models.dev pricing injected into Go usage tracker.** A `CostResolver` callback is now passed to `GoUsageTracker` that reads `modelMetadataSnapshot.providers[GO_VENDOR]?.[modelId]?.cost`. Cost resolution priority: per-request `externalCost` → live models.dev snapshot → bundled `GO_MODEL_PRICING` table (kept as last-resort fallback so the extension stays functional when live fetch fails).
- **`[Usage]` Usage webview hardened (`enableScripts: false`).** The usage details panel is now display-only (SVG render) — message handlers and button scripts removed. Status bar click is disabled; usage details are visible via hover tooltip only.
- **`[Metadata]` models.dev cache TTL reduced from 6 hours to 1 hour.** Detects provider API changes faster, reducing the window where stale metadata causes HTTP 400 errors. Mitigation for [#24](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/24).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **`[Thinking]` Kimi K2.7-code rejects `temperature` and `thinking.type: "disabled"` (dual 400 errors).** The newly released `kimi-k2.7-code` (Moonshot AI) introduced breaking changes from K2.6: (1) `thinking.type` only accepts `"enabled"` — passing `"disabled"` returns HTTP 400 (`invalid thinking: only type=enabled is allowed for this model`); (2) the `temperature` request parameter is rejected (only `1` is allowed). The extension sent both rejected values because the model was unregistered in the fallback metadata and the default thinking setting is `kimi: "off"`. Fix: register `kimi-k2.7-code` in `MODEL_LIMITS_BY_PROVIDER` (context 256000 / output 262144 per models.dev), add to `VISION_CAPABLE_MODELS`, introduce `MODELS_WITHOUT_TEMPERATURE` set that propagates `temperature: false` via `fallbackModelMetadata` so the request body omits the parameter, and special-case `/^kimi-k2\.7/i` in `buildThinkingPayload` to always emit `{ thinking: { type: "enabled", keep: "all" } }` (thinking cannot be disabled for this model). The Thinking picker shows a single "Always On (K2.7)" option with the Moonshot API constraint description. `kimi-k2.6` and `kimi-k2.5` remain unchanged (they accept `disabled`). Fixes [#25](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/25).
- **`[Model Picker]` Agent models no longer duplicated in the Manage Language Models panel.** Replaced the double-registration approach (PR #39/#42) with separate vendor IDs (`opencodego-agent`, `opencodezen-agent`). Each vendor now shows only its own models — zero duplication in any picker or management UI. Agent models are hidden from the Manage panel by default (`showAgentModelsInManagePanel: false`) while still working in the Agents window.

### Added

- **`opencodego.agentsWindow`** boolean setting (default `true`). Controls whether agent-host providers are registered at runtime. When enabled, agent models appear in the Agents window picker.
- **`opencodego.showAgentModelsInManagePanel`** boolean setting (default `false`). Controls whether agent vendors appear in the Manage Language Models panel. Enable to manage agent API keys separately.
- **`resolveBaseVendor()`** helper in `providerTypes.ts` — maps agent vendor IDs back to their base vendor for routing and metadata resolution.
- **`providerVariant()`** helper in `extension.ts` — creates DRY agent provider definitions from base definitions.
- **BYOK key synchronization** — main provider stores API key via `context.secrets.store()` and triggers agent provider re-resolution via `triggerChange()`.

### Changed

- Agent vendors (`opencodego-agent`, `opencodezen-agent`) declared in `package.json` with `when: "config.opencodego.showAgentModelsInManagePanel"` clause.
- `routing.ts` uses `resolveBaseVendor()` before all vendor comparisons to fix routing for agent variants.
- `metadata.ts` `toEffectiveModelId()` vendor parameter widened to accept `AllProviderVendor`.
- Replaces the `opencodego.showInAgentsWindow` setting from PR #42 with the cleaner two-setting approach (`agentsWindow` + `showAgentModelsInManagePanel`).

- **Thinking helpers extracted to `src/thinking.ts` (pure module).** `thinkingFamily`, `buildFamilyThinkingSchema`, `applyRequestThinkingOverride`, `buildThinkingPayload`, and `buildQwenAnthropicThinkingPayload` moved out of `extension.ts` into a new pure module (`src/thinking.ts`) with zero `vscode` dependency. This enables unit testing without mocking the VS Code API surface. `extension.ts` now re-imports all five functions; all call sites unchanged — behavior identical. Unit tests added (`src/test/metadata.test.ts`, `src/test/thinking.test.ts` — 32 tests, all passing).

Fixes [#25](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/25), [#41](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/41). Alternative to PR [#42](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/42) by [@Wallacy](https://github.com/Wallacy).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **`[Model Picker]` Models no longer shown twice in the Language Models management UI.** PR #39 registered each model twice (a general variant + a `::agent-host` variant with `targetChatSessionType: "copilotcli"`) so OpenCode models could appear in the Agents window picker. `filterModelsForSession()` hid the duplicate from the Chat view dropdown and Agents window picker, but the Language Models management UI (BYOK enable/disable list) enumerates the raw registration list with no session filter — so both variants appeared there with a `::agent-host` suffix (issue #41, regression from #39 in v0.3.0).

### Added

- **`opencodego.showInAgentsWindow`** boolean setting (default `false`). Gates the `::agent-host` duplicate behind an explicit opt-in. **Disabled by default** so each model appears exactly once everywhere (pre-#39 behaviour restored). When enabled, an `(Agents)` suffix is added to the duplicate entry's name so the two are visually distinguishable in the Language Models management UI.

### Changed

- **Agents window support is now opt-in.** Users upgrading from v0.3.0 who relied on OpenCode models in the Agents window must now **also** set `"opencodego.showInAgentsWindow": true` (in addition to `extensions.supportAgentsWindow`) to restore model visibility there.

Fixes [#41](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/41). PR [#42](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/42) by [@Marinski](https://github.com/Marinski).

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`[Model Picker]` OpenCode models in the Agents window.** OpenCode Go and Zen models now appear in the VS Code Agents window model picker when starting a Copilot CLI session, alongside Claude and GPT models. Previously they were only visible in the Chat view.
- **Action Required.** Add `"extensions.supportAgentsWindow": { "ltmoerdani.opencode-copilot-chat": true }` to VS Code settings to enable the extension in the Agents window, then reload.

Fixes [#11](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/11). PR [#39](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/39) by [@Marinski](https://github.com/Marinski).

---

## [0.2.9] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **`[Thinking]` "Off" option missing for models.dev effort-only schemas.** Models whose `models.dev` `reasoning_options` contained only `{ type: "effort" }` without `{ type: "toggle" }` (e.g. DeepSeek V4 Flash with `high`, `max`) showed no "Off" option in the Thinking Effort picker — users could not disable reasoning. Fix moves the "off" enum entry outside the `hasToggle` guard so it is always available. Also adds an "on" option for toggle-only models (toggle but no effort values) so they get a proper off/on choice. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/issues/35). PR [#38](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/38) by [@sublimode](https://github.com/sublimode).

### Added

- **Model picker demo GIF.** Added `docs/screenshots/model-picker.gif` showing the Copilot Chat model picker flow with OpenCode models, wired into the README demo section. PR [#37](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/37) by [@sublimode](https://github.com/sublimode).

### Changed

- **README model tables synced with fallback catalog.** Added 15 missing models across the Go and Zen tables to match the bundled `MODEL_LIMITS_BY_PROVIDER` in `src/metadata.ts`. Includes `minimax-m3`, `minimax-m2.1`, `minimax-m2`, `hy3-preview`, `ring-2.6-1t` (Go) and `claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-1`, `claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-haiku-4-5`, `gemini-3-flash`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.2` variants, `gpt-5.1` variants, `gpt-5` variants, `trinity-large-preview-free` (Zen). PR [#34](https://github.com/ltmoerdani/opencode-copilot-chat/pull/34) by [@rupayon123](https://github.com/rupayon123).
- **Community health files.** Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, GitHub Issue templates (bug report, feature request), PR template, `FUNDING.yml`, `dependabot.yml`, and CI workflow (`ci.yml`). Simplified to be beginner-friendly.

### Documentation

- New issue doc: `docs/issues/22-20260614-thinking-off-missing-for-effort-only-schemas.md`

## [0.2.8] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **`[Streaming]` MiniMax M3 `<think>` tag leak — reimplementation.** The `opencodego.stripThinkTags` setting was declared in `package.json` and read from config, but the actual stripping logic was missing from the runtime code — MiniMax M3's inline `<think>...</think>` reasoning blocks leaked directly into the Copilot Chat UI. This fix introduces a new `ThinkTagFilter` class (streaming-safe state machine with partial-tag carry buffer) wired into both `OpenAiResponseExtractor` and `AnthropicResponseExtractor`, all four streaming entry points, and all text extraction paths (`delta.content`, `delta.text`, `content_block_start`, `content_block_delta`, fallback deltas). The extracted thinking content is accumulated into the existing `reasoningContent` pipeline instead of being discarded. Also fixes the `ApiSettings.stripThinkTags` type from `"auto" | "on" | "off"` to `"never" | "auto" | "always"` to match the `package.json` enum. In `"auto"` mode (default), stripping applies only to models matching `/^minimax-m/i`.

---

## [0.2.7] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Kimi thinking format correction.** The `[0.2.4]` changelog entry incorrectly stated that Kimi models use `enable_thinking: true | false`. Tests confirm the OpenCode Go gateway **rejects** `enable_thinking` (HTTP 400: "Extra inputs are not permitted"). The correct format is `thinking: { type: "enabled" | "disabled" }` — matching GLM's format and what the gateway expects for MoonshotAI models on the OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The extension code has been using `thinking: { type }` all along; this entry corrects the record.
- **Respect model `temperature` support from models.dev.** The extension now reads the `temperature: boolean` field from `models.dev` metadata and omits the `temperature` parameter from request payloads when the model declares it unsupported (`temperature: false`). This fixes HTTP 400 errors ("temperature is deprecated for this model.") on models like `claude-opus-4-8` and the GPT-5 family, which have deprecated the temperature parameter.

---

## [0.2.6] — 2026-06-10

### Removed

- **Removed message trimming feature entirely** (`messageTrimmer.ts`). The byte-aware trimming that pruned older conversation turns was too aggressive and disruptive — users reported losing significant context with notifications appearing on every long conversation. Removed all related code: `messageTrimmer.ts` module, trimming logic in `extension.ts`, and payload size safety net in `streaming.ts`.
- **Removed gzip compression** (`node:zlib`). The OpenCode Go/Zen proxy does not support `Content-Encoding: gzip` and returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error when receiving compressed request bodies. All outgoing requests now send raw JSON payloads.

---

## [0.2.5] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Removed gzip compression** — the OpenCode Go/Zen proxy does **not** support `Content-Encoding: gzip` and returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error when receiving compressed request bodies. All outgoing requests now send raw JSON payloads. Message trimming (`messageTrimmer.ts`) remains the primary mechanism for keeping payloads under the proxy's ~400 KB body limit.

---

## [0.2.4] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Byte-aware message trimming.** New `messageTrimmer.ts` module provides `trimApiMessages()` which prunes older conversation turns when the messages array exceeds a byte budget (~800 KB). Always preserves the system prompt, full conversation turns, and tool-call atomicity. A subtle notification is shown to the user when a significant portion (>30%) of context is trimmed.
- **Context Size selector for tiered-pricing models.** Models with `cost.tiers[]` or `cost.context_over_200k` in their `models.dev` metadata now expose a **Context Size** dropdown in the VS Code model picker (e.g. `256K` ↔ `1M`). The selected value caps the effective `maxInputTokens` for each request, matching the pricing structure declared by the upstream provider. Supported for both OpenCode Go and OpenCode Zen models.
- **Dynamic reasoning options from models.dev.** When a model's `models.dev` entry declares explicit `reasoning_options` (e.g. `[{type:"effort",values:["low","medium","high","max"]}]`), the model picker renders those exact effort levels, overriding the family-based hardcoded defaults. The `reasoningOptions` field is propagated through `ModelMetadataFields` → `ResolvedModelMetadata` → `modelConfigurationSchema()`.
- **Thinking controls for Mimo and MiniMax models.** MiniMax (`minimax-m*`) models now support on/off thinking only (`thinking: { type: "disabled"|"adaptive"|"enabled" }` — the OpenCode gateway does not expose `reasoning_effort` for this family, as verified in the official `transform.ts`). Mimo (`mimo-v2.*`) models support `off`/`low`/`medium`/`high` reasoning effort levels. DeepSeek (`deepseek-v4-*`) models support `off`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`max` — matching the upstream OpenCode reasoning effort options sourced from the official OpenCode provider `transform.ts`. The `opencodego.thinking.mimo`, `opencodego.thinking.minimax` and `opencodego.thinking.deepseek` settings have been updated with the corrected enum values.
- **Kimi thinking format corrected.** Kimi models (`kimi-k2.5`, `kimi-k2.6`) on the OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint now send `enable_thinking: true | false` (MoonshotAI-native boolean) instead of the Anthropic-style `thinking: { type: "enabled" | "disabled" }` object, which was silently ignored. The `opencodego.thinking.kimi` setting description updated accordingly.
- **Dynamic configuration schema** — any model with `reasoning: true` in its resolved metadata (from `models.dev`, live API, or bundled fallback) automatically gets a generic `off`/`on` Thinking Effort control in the model picker, without requiring a hardcoded family mapping. Future reasoning-capable models will work out of the box.
- New settings `opencodego.thinking.mimo` (`"off"` / `"low"` / `"medium"` / `"high"`, default `"off"`) and expanded `opencodego.thinking.deepseek` (`"off"` / `"low"` / `"medium"` / `"high"` / `"max"`, default `"off"`).
- New setting `opencodego.stripThinkTags` (`"auto"` / `"on"` / `"off"`, default `"auto"`) — strips `<!--<think-->...<!--</think-->` tags from model output. In `"auto"` mode, stripping applies only to known models that inline reasoning in content (MiniMax M3 family). Merged from main (`v0.2.2`).

### Changed

- **Merged `main` into `develop`** — all features from `main` (Mimo thinking, context size selector, dynamic reasoning, strip think tags, icon refresh) are now unified with develop-only features (gzip compression, message trimming) into a single coherent branch.
- Streaming layer cleaned up — removed gzip compression logic that caused proxy 500 errors. SSE parsing and request flow remain unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed merge conflict in `modelLimits()` signature — `contextSizeOverride` parameter from main is now correctly combined with develop's message trimming logic.
- Fixed missing `stripThinkTags` property on `ApiSettings` interface after merge.
- Fixed missing closing parenthesis on `stripThinkTags` config getter that caused TypeScript parse error.
- Fixed `Buffer` not found TypeScript error by replacing `Buffer.from(part.data).toString("utf8")` with `new TextDecoder().decode(part.data)` in `estimateDataPartTokenCount`.

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- Refreshed extension icon (`opencodego.png` and `opencodego.svg`) with a redesigned visual featuring gradient backgrounds, subtle grid pattern, glow effects, and sparkle accents for a more polished marketplace presence.

### Changed

- Cleaned up the "OpenCode" output channel by removing all verbose debug and informational logs. The output channel was previously flooded with per-model registration logs, per-request summaries, streaming stats, metadata refresh messages, and usage tracking lines. Now the output channel only surfaces error-level messages (e.g. `ERROR model=...`) and critical warnings (empty response, rate limits, HTTP errors), keeping it clean for production use. All removed diagnostic data was already accessible through the extension's diagnostics document and status bar indicators.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Buffer` not found TypeScript error by replacing `Buffer.from(part.data).toString("utf8")` with `new TextDecoder().decode(part.data)` in `estimateDataPartTokenCount`. `TextDecoder` is a Web API available in all JS environments without requiring `@types/node`.

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Strip `<think>...</think>` tags from model output when enabled. For streaming responses, the inner thinking content is accumulated into the reasoning pipeline and displayed via the existing reasoning fallback. For non-streaming fallback, the tags are removed and only the surrounding text is kept. Gated by the new `opencodego.stripThinkTags` setting (`"auto"` / `"always"` / `"never"`). In `"auto"` mode (default), stripping applies only to known models that inline reasoning in `<think>` tags within the content field (MiniMax M3 family).

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-06

### Removed

- Removed the unused `opencodego.showUsage` command, `showGoUsagePanel` WebView panel, and related activation event. The Go Usage Tracker details are still accessible via the status bar indicator (`Go: XX%·XX%·XX%`). The separate Quick Pick panel was removed because the status bar already provides glanceable usage data and the dedicated panel added unnecessary code complexity without proportional user benefit.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added **Go Usage Tracker** — real-time tracking of OpenCode Go subscription limits as percentages in the status bar and a Quick Pick panel.
  - Tracks 5-hour rolling ($12), weekly ($30), and monthly ($60) limits per the OpenCode Go subscription tiers.
  - Calculates client-side cost from token usage × per-model pricing (input, output, cache_read) for every Go model.
  - Status bar indicator (`Go: 27%·62%·75%`) shows 5h / weekly / monthly usage at a glance, with ⚠ warning when any period exceeds 80%.
  - Click the status bar to open a detailed Quick Pick panel showing progress bars, today/yesterday breakdown, and actions to open diagnostics console or reset data.
  - Usage log persisted in VS Code `globalState` so data survives editor restarts.
  - New command: `OpenCode Go: Show Usage` (`opencodego.showUsage`).

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Fixed Qwen models returning 401 error ("Model qwen3.7-max is not supported for format oa-compat"). Qwen models on the OpenCode Go gateway are only available through the Anthropic Messages API endpoint, not the OpenAI chat-completions endpoint. Reverted the routing while fixing the actual root cause. _Background: the initial investigation on 2026-05-15 identified that `qwen3.6-plus-free` uses an Anthropic-bridged gateway that re-derives tools from message history, causing infinite tool-call loops (see `docs/issues/01-20260515-qwen36-tool-call-loop.md`)._
- Fixed Anthropic streaming tool call parsing in `AnthropicResponseExtractor`. The extractor now correctly handles Anthropic SSE event types (`content_block_start` with `tool_use` blocks, `content_block_delta` with `input_json_delta`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`) so Qwen tool calls are properly captured and surfaced to VS Code Copilot Chat.
- Fixed Anthropic usage metadata parsing. Added support for Anthropic-native fields (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`) in addition to OpenAI fields, so the context window indicator updates correctly for Qwen models routed through the messages endpoint.
- Fixed Qwen thinking payload format when routed through the Anthropic messages endpoint. Qwen thinking settings are now translated to Anthropic-native format (`{ type: "enabled"|"disabled" }`) instead of Qwen-native `enable_thinking` boolean, matching what the OpenCode gateway expects.

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Fixed Qwen models (`qwen3.5-plus`, `qwen3.6-plus`, `qwen3.6-plus-free`, `qwen3.7-max`) not being able to call VS Code tools (file reading, terminal, etc.) and responding with short answers without follow-through. The root cause was Qwen being incorrectly routed to the Anthropic Messages API (`/messages`) which uses a different tool calling format (`tool_use` content blocks) than Qwen's native OpenAI-compatible format (`choices[].delta.tool_calls`). All Qwen models now correctly route to the chat-completions endpoint (`/chat/completions`) where tool calls are properly parsed and surfaced to Copilot Chat.
- Fixed context window indicator not updating for Qwen models by ensuring the response streaming path correctly reports usage metadata back to VS Code.

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- Added support for VS Code's `languageModelPricing` proposed API, exposing `pricing`, `inputCost`, `outputCost`, `cacheCost`, and `priceCategory` on every registered model so the model picker and management UI can display real cost metadata.
- Parsed per-model cost data from the live `models.dev` registry (`cost.input`, `cost.output`, `cost.cache_read`, `cost.cache_write`) and converted USD values to AI Credits (`1 USD = 100 AI credits`) for native VS Code consumption.
- Added modality detection from `models.dev` metadata, surfacing audio, video, and PDF input support in model tooltips and detail badges alongside the existing vision indicator.

### Changed

- Removed the `opencodego.experimentalContextIndicator` configuration setting and its associated context-window hook bridge; the same capability was already implemented natively in commit `ca8bbb6` and the redundant experimental path is no longer needed.
- Consolidated duplicate local type definitions (`BaseModelLimits`, `ModelMetadataFields`, `CachedModelMetadataSnapshot`, `ResolvedModelMetadata`) that were shadowing the canonical types in `metadata.ts`, ensuring `cost` and modality fields flow correctly through the metadata pipeline.
- Bumped the cached `models.dev` snapshot key from `v3` to `v4` so users automatically re-fetch the registry on next activation and pick up the freshly added `cost` and modality data, instead of consuming stale cached entries that did not carry those fields.
- Aligned the `priceCategory` thresholds with the Copilot extension's 3:1 input:output weighted blend so low/medium/high/very_high buckets line up with what the user sees for the official Copilot models (e.g. Kimi k2.6 is `medium`, GPT-5.4 is `medium`, Claude Opus 4.5 is `high`, GPT-5.4 Pro is `very_high`).

### Fixed

- Corrected the `modelCapabilities` return type to use the official `vscode.LanguageModelChatCapabilities` shape (`imageInput`, `toolCalling`, `supportsImageToText`, `supportsToolCalling`) instead of ad-hoc fields, aligning with how VS Code internally maps provider capabilities to `vision` / `toolCalling` / `agentMode`.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added recent OpenCode transport summaries to the Go and Zen diagnostics reports, including endpoint, initiator, metadata source, request IDs, token usage, latency, and error details for the last provider requests.
- Persist recent diagnostics request summaries in VS Code global state so the request history survives extension host reloads and can be reused if VS Code later exposes richer BYOK debug surfaces.
- Added a usage status bar summary with prompt/output/total/cache data after each OpenCode response.
- Added OpenCode usage DataPart emission so later Copilot Chat integrations can consume normalized prompt/output/cache metadata without re-parsing raw transport logs.
- Added an opt-in experimental context-indicator hook that can inject real BYOK usage into the Copilot Chat footer using VS Code internals.

### Changed

- Extracted the OpenCode transport and SSE parsing layer into a dedicated `streaming.ts` module so provider wiring, request building, and stream normalization can evolve independently.
- Keep capturing request usage and finish metadata even when VS Code's native Agent Debug Log does not surface custom BYOK provider telemetry.
- Enriched OpenCode output logging with normalized usage lines, finish reasons, and cache hit ratio when the upstream provider reports cache metadata.
- Route provider progress and usage through a local request-id bridge so the experimental context hook can bind real request usage back to VS Code's internal chat request ids.
- Simplified the Anthropic `/messages` request builder by removing dead branches and consolidating repeated text extraction helpers after the qwen3.7 transport fix.
- Refreshed the bundled fallback catalogs to match the current OpenCode Go catalog and the current free/paid Zen catalogs.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode `/messages` authentication to follow the gateway contract (`x-api-key` for Anthropic-style routes, bearer auth for OpenAI-style routes), which restores OpenCode Go `qwen3.7-max` in Copilot Chat.
- Fixed the OpenCode `/messages` body builder to emit Anthropic-compatible message blocks instead of forwarding OpenAI-shaped payloads to that endpoint.
- Aligned OpenCode Go and Zen Qwen routing with the current official endpoint docs: Go `qwen3.5-plus`, `qwen3.6-plus`, and `qwen3.7-max`, plus Zen `qwen3.5-plus` / `qwen3.6-plus`, now use `/messages`.
- Report provider token usage back to VS Code via `LanguageModelDataPart` MIME `usage` so Copilot Chat's Context Window widget can display used tokens instead of staying at 0%.
- Improved local token counting for chat messages, tool calls, tool results, JSON/data parts, and image attachments.
- Logged raw HTTP error bodies in the OpenCode output channel so provider-specific backend failures can be diagnosed without reproducing requests manually.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added configurable OpenCode request and streaming idle timeouts so Copilot Chat requests fail clearly instead of hanging indefinitely.
- Added sticky OpenCode request headers (`x-opencode-session`, `x-opencode-request`, `x-opencode-client`) so Go and Zen requests preserve gateway affinity behavior.
- Added clearer rate-limit and quota handling, including retry/quota details from response headers when available.
- Added a TTL-cached models.dev metadata snapshot, merged with live `/models` metadata and a bundled fallback catalog for offline picker registration.
- Added native Zen GPT routing through `/responses` and Zen Gemini routing through the documented Google-style `/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` endpoint.

### Changed

- Corrected fallback-advertised model limits to follow `models.dev` whenever the live `/models` payload does not provide limit metadata, fixing earlier Go/Zen cross-provider mix-ups in the bundled table.
- This reduces several previously overstated fallback values, notably `deepseek-v4-flash-free` to `200000 / 128000`, `glm-5` and `glm-5.1` to `202752 / 32768`, and Go `minimax-m2.5` to `204800 / 65536`.

### Fixed

- Updated bundled fallback limits and capability hints so the picker stays usable when neither `/models` nor models.dev can be refreshed.
- Zen Claude, Zen GPT, Zen Gemini, and Go MiniMax families now use the correct transport automatically instead of being forced through a single OpenAI-compatible route.

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Fixed vision requests with image attachments failing before upload due to stack overflow while encoding image bytes.
- Avoid forcing Qwen `thinking_budget` on vision requests when Thinking is set to Auto, reducing image request token pressure from Alibaba-backed models.
- Stopped advertising image input support for models that do not support image attachments in OpenCode metadata: `glm-5`, `glm-5.1`, `minimax-m2.5`, `minimax-m2.7`, `minimax-m2.5-free`, `mimo-v2-pro`, and `mimo-v2.5-pro`.

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- Added `opencodego.freeOnly` to control whether the OpenCode Zen provider exposes only free models or the full Zen catalog.
- Added native per-model Thinking configuration schema for DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, and Qwen models.
- Added `reasoningEffort` support for Thinking controls and request logging for selected model configuration and final Thinking payload.

### Fixed

- Preserved numeric model versions in picker labels, so Zen model IDs like `claude-opus-4-5` now display as `Claude Opus 4.5` instead of `Claude Opus 4 5`.
- Bumped model metadata revision to force VS Code to refresh model-picker configuration metadata, including corrected model labels.
- Sanitized Copilot tool schemas before forwarding them to OpenCode providers, avoiding Moonshot/Kimi 400 errors caused by `$ref` schemas with sibling descriptions.
- Sent Qwen chat requests through the OpenCode chat-completions endpoint while preserving hybrid OpenAI/Anthropic stream parsing, avoiding the `/messages` auth path that returned `Missing API key`.
- Filter deprecated OpenCode models using the models.dev registry before registering them with VS Code, with a local safety list for free models that now return provider 404s (`ring-2.6-1t-free`, `trinity-large-preview-free`).
- Removed stale unavailable models from bundled fallback lists so offline fallback does not reintroduce models that can no longer serve requests.
- API errors now use the active provider display name instead of always saying `OpenCode Go`.

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Context size now correct in picker and chat bar.** Removed the formula that inflated `advertisedContextWindow` by adding `maxOutputTokens` on top of `contextWindow`, which caused VS Code to round up and display `2M` for models with 262K or 1M actual context.
- **Model limits ported from models.dev (official OpenCode registry).** All context and output limits are now sourced from the authoritative `models.dev/api.json` registry, fixing previously wrong values across most models:
  - `qwen3.6-plus-free` / `qwen3.6-plus` / `qwen3.5-plus`: corrected from 1 M → **262 K** context
  - `glm-5` / `glm-5.1` max output: corrected from 32 K → **131 K**
  - `minimax-m2.5` max output: corrected from 65 K → **131 K**
  - `mimo-v2-omni` max output: corrected from 65 K → **128 K**
  - `hy3-preview`: corrected from 262 K / 128 K → **256 K / 64 K**
  - `ring-2.6-1t-free`: corrected to **262 K / 66 K**
  - `trinity-large-preview-free`: corrected to **131 K / 131 K**
  - `nemotron-3-super-free`: corrected from 262 K → **204 K** context, 65 K → **128 K** output
  - `big-pickle`: corrected from 262 K → **200 K** context, 65 K → **128 K** output
- **Model limits are now per-provider (Zen vs Go).** `MODEL_LIMITS_BY_PROVIDER` prevents Go and Zen limits from contaminating each other when both providers expose a model with the same ID (e.g. `qwen3.6-plus`, `glm-5.1`, `minimax-m2.7`).
- **Hard cache-bust for VS Code picker metadata.** Model `id`, `family`, and `version` fields now encode a per-revision token (`ctxfix-2026-05-16-b`) so VS Code drops stale context-size metadata after this update instead of showing old values.
- **API requests always use the raw upstream model ID**, never the revisioned effective ID, so backend routing is unaffected by the cache-bust strategy.
- **`qwen3.6-plus-free` deprecation label corrected.** Earlier sessions incorrectly labelled the model as deprecated based on a community PR that was ultimately rejected. The model is actively re-enabled by the OpenCode team ("Round 2 — found more GPUs"). Label is now "Limited capacity" with a note to retry on 5xx rather than "Deprecated upstream".

### Changed

- `provideLanguageModelChatResponse` now resolves the raw model ID via `model.rawModelId` before calling `modelLimits()` and forwarding the ID to the backend, so the revisioned effective ID is never sent to the OpenCode API.
- `modelLimits()` now accepts an optional `vendor` parameter; callers inside `OpenCodeProvider` pass `this.definition.vendor` for accurate per-provider lookups.

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added `opencodego.debugReasoning` to write provider `reasoning_content` to **Output → OpenCode** for opt-in debugging.
- Added a separate native **OpenCode Zen** provider (`opencodezen`) with its own BYOK configuration flow and free-model list from `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models`.
- Added `OpenCode Zen: Diagnostics` for inspecting Zen models registered with VS Code.

### Fixed

- Kept advertised context-size metadata consistent across the Language Models table, Copilot model picker tooltip, and chat context indicator while preserving the full OpenCode Go max-output limit for API requests.
- Improved provider token counting for mixed chat/tool content so Copilot receives a more realistic context usage estimate.
- Stopped resolving an extra unconfigured OpenCode Go model group from the legacy command-stored API key.
- Native Language Models entries are now produced only for configured provider groups, preventing duplicate model rows.
- Cached native BYOK API keys per resolved model so Copilot chat requests continue to work when VS Code does not pass provider configuration into `provideLanguageModelChatResponse`.
- Implemented OpenAI-compatible streaming tool-call parsing and conversion to `LanguageModelToolCallPart`, enabling Copilot Agent tool loops for file reads, search, edits, and workspace actions.
- Preserved assistant tool calls and tool results when converting VS Code chat history back into OpenAI-compatible messages.
- Captured and replayed DeepSeek `reasoning_content` on follow-up tool-result requests so thinking-mode models can continue multi-step tool workflows without provider errors.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Switched the Language Models gear flow to VS Code's native provider configuration schema.
- Added `apiKey` as a secret provider configuration field so configure/add prompts proceed from **Group Name** to **OpenCode Go API Key**.
- Provider now reads the configured API key from VS Code's language model configuration, with the command-stored key kept as a fallback.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added

- Initial public release on VS Code Marketplace
- Live model list fetched from `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models` on activation
- Bundled fallback model metadata table (context window + max output tokens per model)
- Dual endpoint routing: OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` for standard models, Anthropic-compatible `/messages` for MiniMax M2 models
- Tool-calling support forwarded to both endpoint types
- `OpenCode Go: Manage Provider` command — model selection and management dialog
- `OpenCode Go: Set API Key` command — stores API key in VS Code Secret Storage
- `OpenCode Go: Diagnostics` command — renders a markdown report of all registered models
- Settings: `opencodego.temperature`, `opencodego.maxTokens`, `opencodego.maxInputTokens`
- Per-model token limit overrides via `opencodego.maxInputTokens` and `opencodego.maxTokens`
