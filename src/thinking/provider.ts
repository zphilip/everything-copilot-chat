/**
 * Thinking provider registry.
 *
 * Each model family has its own strategy class (see `./deepseek.ts` etc.),
 * selected by {@link thinkingProviderFor}. This module owns the interface and
 * the single routing point from a raw model id to its strategy.
 *
 * The family→strategy mapping itself is DATA-DRIVEN: which family a model
 * belongs to comes from `core/registry.ts` (the shared model registry also
 * used by the transport router), so a family's wiring lives in one table.
 *
 * CONTRACT: pure only — no `vscode` import, no side effects.
