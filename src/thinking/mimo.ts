/**
 * Mimo (Xiaomi) thinking strategy.
 *
 * Uses `reasoning_effort` + a `budget_tokens` cap per effort level to prevent
 * the infinite thinking loops observed in mimo-v2.5 / mimo-v2.5-pro (issue #36).
 *
 * DISPLAY: Mimo is a native reasoning model — `reasoning_content` is always
 * genuine chain-of-thought and goes to the thinking panel, never surfaced as
 * visible text. (The old #37635 gateway mislabel — wrapping answers in
 * `reasoning_content` — is a gateway bug, not worked around here.)
