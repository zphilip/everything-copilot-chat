/**
 * Muse Spark (Meta) thinking strategy.
 *
 * Muse Spark models route through the OpenAI Responses API where reasoning
 * is a nested `reasoning: { effort }` object — same wire format as GPT 5.x.
 *
 * DISPLAY: Muse Spark is a native reasoning model — `reasoning_content` is
 * always genuine chain-of-thought and goes to the thinking panel.
 *
 * NOTE: The OpenCode gateway currently returns Muse Spark reasoning as
 * `encrypted_content` (opaque, not decryptable client-side) rather than
 * plaintext `reasoning_content` / `summary[].text`. Until the gateway relays
 * plaintext reasoning, thinking blocks will remain empty even when
 * `reasoning.effort` is set. This is an upstream limitation, not a client
 * parsing issue — see `src/core/routing.ts:extractResponsesReasoningText`.
