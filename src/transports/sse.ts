/**
 * Pure: decide whether an SSE stream ended abnormally (truncated/aborted).
 *
 * Only transports that emit a `data: [DONE]` terminator (`usesDoneSentinel`)
 * can be trusted to signal completion via its absence. OpenAI-style transports
 * (chat-completions, Responses API) do; Google (`streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`,
 * native SSE) and Anthropic (`/messages`, `message_stop`) do NOT, and their
 * `finishReason` can be legitimately `null`/absent on a healthy stream. Gating
 * truncation detection on `usesDoneSentinel` avoids false-positive errors on
 * those transports (a healthy Gemini response whose finishReason normalizes to
 * `null` must not be reported as truncated).
 *
 * For a `[DONE]` transport, if the connection closed (`done`) without `[DONE]`
 * AND without a captured `finish_reason` while bytes were received, the stream
 * was cut off mid-response (gateway dropped the connection, proxy reset,
 * upstream crash) and must not be treated as a silent success. This includes
 * streams whose bytes never extracted into parts (keep-alives / unrecognized
 * frames only): bytes arrived, so the connection worked — a healthy OpenCode
 * stream always ends with `[DONE]`, so its absence here is abnormal regardless
 * of how much content was extracted.
