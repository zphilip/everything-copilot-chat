/**
 * CONTRACT — Reasoning surfacing via LanguageModelThinkingPart
 *
 * RULES:
 *   1. `LanguageModelThinkingPart` is a proposed VS Code API available at
 *      runtime since VS Code ~1.102 (Aug 2025). Our `engines.vscode: ^1.125.0`
 *      guarantees it is present, but we guard defensively so the extension
 *      degrades gracefully on any hypothetical older host.
 *   2. When available, reasoning is streamed to the Copilot Chat UI per-chunk
 *      as a thinking part. This lets `chat.agent.thinkingStyle`
 *      (`collapsed` / `collapsedPreview` / `fixedScrolling`) apply, fixing
 *      issues #22 and #71.
 *   3. When NOT available (very old host), the caller falls back to the
 *      legacy accumulate-and-flush behavior (reasoning emitted as a
 *      LanguageModelTextPart only when the response is otherwise empty).
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - Never throws: if the constructor is missing or `progress.report` fails,
 *     the reasoning is silently dropped (the visible response is unaffected).
 *   - The returned boolean tells the caller whether the thinking part was
 *     successfully emitted, so the caller can decide whether to also
 *     accumulate into `reasoningContent` for the legacy fallback path.
