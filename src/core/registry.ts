/**
 * Data-driven model registry — the single source of truth for "which model
 * family uses which transport + thinking strategy".
 *
 * Adding a new model family = adding ONE row here (+ optionally a thinking
 * strategy class in `src/thinking/`). Both the transport router
 * (`core/routing.ts` → {@link resolveModelRouting}) and the thinking-family
 * detector (`thinking/provider.ts` → {@link thinkingFamily}) consult this
 * table, so a family's wiring never lives in two places again.
 *
 * Per-model context limits / capabilities / cost are NOT in this table —
 * those come from the live models.dev metadata (`models/metadata.ts`), which
 * is already data-driven. The registry covers the two places that used to
 * hardcode per-family decisions in code.
 *
 * CONTRACT: pure — no `vscode` import, no side effects.
