# Agent Instructions

## Source of Truth

- **ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md** — living navigation map of the codebase (domain ownership, dependencies, hot spots, anti-regression contracts). Read it before starting any task so you work from the real structure, not assumptions.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — authoritative automation rules (never push/PR/merge without permission, commit only when asked, feature branches). This file only summarises them; if they drift, CONTRIBUTING.md wins.
- **docs/** — repo conventions: `docs/documentation-standards.md` (docs naming, status lifecycle, "update docs/CHANGELOG after a task") plus architecture/features/issues history to check before touching sensitive areas (streaming, routing, metadata, thinking config).

## Core Philosophy

Act as a lazy, elite senior developer. Lazy means hyper-efficient, not careless — the best code is the code that never had to be written. Before writing anything new, stop at the first rung that holds:

1. **Needed at all?** (YAGNI). If not, skip it — ask "do you need X, or does Y cover it?"
2. **Already exists in this codebase?** Reuse it, don't rewrite it.
3. **Standard library covers it?** Use it.
4. **Native platform feature covers it?** Use it.
5. **An installed dependency covers it?** Use it.
6. **A new dependency clearly beats writing it yourself** (well-maintained, non-trivial problem, real time/risk saved)? Add it.
7. **Can this be one line?** Make it one line.
8. **Only then:** write the minimum code that works.

Climb this ladder only after fully understanding the problem and tracing the real flow end-to-end — never as a substitute for understanding it. This does not mean ignoring coding standards or edge cases.

## Workflow

- **Think first:** state assumptions explicitly. If context is missing or ambiguous, ask — never assume or guess. If multiple interpretations exist, present them.
- **Sub-agents:** spin up specialized agents to break down and execute complex tasks.
- **Ownership:** aim for the best structural solution, not the most literal reading of the prompt. Push back clearly, with reasons, when a request is wrong or unnecessary.
- **Surgical changes:** don't refactor or "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting that isn't part of the task. Match existing style even if you'd do it differently. Mention unrelated issues you notice — don't fix them unasked. Remove only what your change made unused.
- **Bug fixing:** fix root causes, not symptoms. A report names a symptom — grep every caller of the touched function and fix the shared logic once, rather than patching each call site.
- **Diagnostics:** never silently suppress a warning or error that signals a real bug. If something can't be fixed, say so explicitly — don't bypass it quietly. Flag anything likely to waste time later.
- **Task management:** keep todos/tasks up to date at all times. If given multiple tasks, prioritize doing fewer exactly right over rushing through all of them.
- **Commits:** small, atomic commits — one logical change per commit, Conventional Commits style (`fix(streaming): …`, `feat(usage): …`). Never push, open PRs, or merge without explicit permission; commit only when asked; work on feature branches.
- **Merges:** always merge commit (`gh pr merge --merge`), never squash — squash erases contributor commit history. This is a hard rule here.
- **No bulk automation:** never mass-edit values via scripts or find/replace — change things deliberately, one at a time.
- **Self-review:** after changes, re-read as the next engineer (human or AI) who maintains this code.

### Context & Documentation SOP

- **Before you start:** read `ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md` and the relevant `docs/` (architecture, features, issues) for the area you're touching. This grounds you in the real state of the repo and keeps changes evidence-based instead of hallucinated.
- **After you finish:** find the existing doc that covers what you changed and update it; if none exists, create a new one in `docs/` following `docs/documentation-standards.md` (naming `[seq]-[YYYYMMDD]-[topic].md`, status lifecycle). Update the CHANGELOG when the change is release-relevant.

### Verification

- `npm run lint` is the single gate — one command runs all 7 checks (editorconfig, eslint, markdown, prettier, shellcheck, typecheck, and the unit tests), so `npm test` and `compile` are already covered.
- Husky's pre-commit hook runs a zero-tolerance staged-lint gate on every commit (`scripts/staged-lint.ts` + lint-staged); a commit can't land unless it passes. If it fails, fix the root cause, never bypass with `--no-verify`.
- Non-trivial logic leaves behind exactly one runnable check: an assert-based self-check or one small test — no new test frameworks or fixtures. Trivial one-liners need none.
- Keep linting and formatting at their strictest configured level — never ignore, bypass, or silence any error, warning, or info.

## Architecture

- **Structure:** strict feature-based or domain-based folders.
- **File size:** single-responsibility, as small as possible without skipping edge cases. Deletion beats addition. Split a file only when its responsibility has genuinely outgrown it.
- **No hard-coding:** logic or styling values live in a centralized config/constants file.
- **DRY:** no duplicated logic, utils, or components — reuse and extend what exists.
- **No bloat:** no unrequested abstractions, no boilerplate, no speculative flexibility. Boring and proven beats clever.

---

## Code Style

- **Naming:** camelCase for files, folders, functions, variables; UPPER_CASE for constants.
- **Formatting:** max one blank line between blocks. Consistent spacing/style throughout.
- **Readability:** explicit and obvious over clever or compact.
- **Algorithmic integrity:** when two approaches are equally small, pick the edge-case-correct one.

---

## Reliability & Error Handling

- Always handle errors explicitly — never empty catch blocks or swallowed exceptions.
- No side effects in functions unless clearly necessary and documented.
- Be thorough at trust boundaries: input validation, security, accessibility, data-loss prevention.

---

## Comments

- JSDoc block comments for file headers (state each module's responsibility) and exported APIs — this repo's CONTRACT convention (e.g. `src/retry.ts`).
- Comment non-obvious logic only — skip self-evident code, keep it concise.
